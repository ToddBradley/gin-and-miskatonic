# Journal


## Monday January 19, 1925


### From the journal of Lawrence Simons


#### The Morning

We have finally accepted that our old friend Oxford "Ox" Sykes will not be joining us on our current explorations. However, I learned that Dr. Filmore, the surgeon assigned to the Lyon Field Hospital that I met during the war, was also a friend of Jackson Elias. He arrived in Manhattan today, and we were reacquainted at the Ramsey Law Office. More on that in a bit.

After breakfast, we pursued two parallel lines of investigation.

Jerry went to the New York Public Library in search of any references to the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. But he found none.

Meanwhile, Aaron and I went to the Juju House to scope it out. It's at 132nd and Ransom Court. Inside was an old man in a red blanket, who we assumed must be Silas N’Kwame, the Mombasan owner we had heard about. He seemed forthcoming enough with information, and we learned that Dr. Mordecai Lemming is a regular buyer of his merchandise. Lemming lives at the Murray Hill Hotel, and is a crackpot. Ahja Singh is his supplier. Some of Juju's products are local, some imported. The store is open from 9am to 5pm each day except Sunday, and closed from noon to 1pm for lunch. We got the impression that Mr. N'Kwame's home is adjacent to his shop, through the door we noticed behind the counter.


#### Unexpected Reunion

After a lunch of pastrami sandwiches, we met at the Ramsey Law Office, and that's when we met up with Dr. Filmore for the first time in several years. Mr. Ramsey shared a nice bottle of bourbon, to accompany the reading of the will. But rather than reading the will itself, Mr. Ramsey instead read a letter that Elias had written for us, before his death. He sensed he was in great danger, and updated his affairs with his lawyer only a day before he was killed.


#### The Final Letter from Jackson Elias

> Greetings from beyond the grave!
> 
> By now you know that all I've really left you is a whole heap of trouble. If I were still around to have an opinion on the matter, I would understand if you decided to walk away from it all. Hell, if I'm dead right now, that's a good indication I should have done the same. But you know me too well, and I know you too well. If you were the kind of person who always did the sensible thing we wouldn't be such good friends.
> 
> You have been there when I needed you in the past and I hope you will be again, even if it's too late to save me. I've been pulling threads all over the world, and while most of them are still unravelling I think I'm onto something big. Carlton and Jonah can fill in more of the details for you - I've left some of my papers and notes with them, which should help you work out which hornets nests you need to poke next.
> 
> I trust you to bring my killers to justice. Of course, I'm assuming I was murdered - it will be just plain embarrassing if was run over by a trolley car! Follow my investigation to its bloody end, and seek out the truth. I'm not asking you to finish my book — none of you can write worth a damn.
> 
> Your friend always,
> 
> Jackson
>

#### The Rest of the Details

Ramsey is now in charge of what remains in Elias' bank account. Jackson appointed him as a trustee for it, and wants the money to be used by us to continue his investigations. We decided to name this venture **The Good Friends of Jackson Elias, Inc.**.

At this point, we have the following obvious areas of investigation ahead of us:

* Miss Carlyle in NYC
* Break into Juju House to look at the business' books (and maybe discover who their biggest customers are)
* Visit the Harvard Library to find out more about the missing book
* Prepare for the upcoming eclipse, and another possible murder

#### That Night

Once things wrapped up at the law office, we went to the Juju House to stake it out. We saw Silas leaving the place, and sent Stig to follow Silas, with instructions to make sure he doesn't come back in under an hour.

Before breaking into the Juju House, we noticed a locked door in the alley that Aaron was able to pick. We snuck inside and found that it's the abandoned storefront of a former pawn shop - two rooms with some basic cabinets, desks, etc. There's nothing of interest here, but it could be a handy place for us to stake out Juju House.

Then we proceeded to the Juju House. Aaron's lockpicking skills were not on display, and he had to break the lock to get in. Father Jerry stayed outside as a guard, while Aaron, Dr. Filmore (Kenny), and I went into the store. I took the business ledger and stuffed it in my satchel, to be analyzed later. Aaron spotted a fancy Bloody Tongue headpiece, and took that. When he realized the red ribbon had been replaced by a real human tongue, I think he turned even whiter than normal. Kenny found a trap door under the rug, which revealed stone stairs leading 20 feet down.

There were strange runes and symbols carved onto the walls. Kenny took some etchings, while I took a photo or two. That led to a locked reinforced door with straps and bars and some different carvings. Again, Kenny took etchings and I took a photo. Nobody could get the lock open, so we took the pins out of the hingest, allowing us to open the door from the other side.

This led to a large room with a 15' high ceiling. It was made of very nice dressed stone, and reminded me of a courthouse or Freemason lodge. There were torches on the walls, and a circular stone block on the floor with a cranked chain to lift it. I played the "Skinny Larry" card, and got Kenny and Aaron to lift the block up. It revealed an 8' diameter pit.

Inside the pit was something unnatural. I didn't see it, but I heard it. The shrieking was worse than a dozen French soldiers walking into a surprise cloud of mustard gas. Aaron viewed it from above. He later described it a "large, amorphous blob, covered in human faces." Frankly, I think this... creature, or whatever you want to call it... had an impact on his famously unflappable "there's a scientific explanation for everything" attitude. He got a couple of photos. I could barely stand the horrible screams from the thing, so we headed out just as quick as we could.

But on the way out, Aaron stirred up four things. People? Creatures? They moved, looked, and smelled like the animated dead. Each of the four had scars on their heads in the same pattern as those that the assassins carved into Jackson's head on his death bed. I made a quick photograph of them as well. I hope these photographs come out well.

We rushed back up the stairs, and realized that there is really no way to hide the break-in. We couldn't put the stone lid back on the pit without confronting the undead guardians and the horrible noise. And we didn't stop to put the door back on its hinges. So, since it's going to be obvious someone broke in to the Juju House, I decided to try to mislead whoever visits next. I wrote a short note and left it on the counter. It says, "The deal is off. Robson."
