# Journal


## From the journal of Lawrence Simons

## Wednesday January 21, 1925 (continued)

Once we found the figurative Achille's heel of the zombies, we dispatched the other three in short order by aiming for the head. With the last one gone, something of a calm came over the obcene underground cult chapel. But then we heard movement in the pit.

We found a ton of cult stuff behind the curtain - a cult robe, lion claws, the missing book (that Harvard librarian will be so pleased), a weird four-faced mask, another bloody tongue headband, a scepter, a fancy feathered robe, a bowl, a mysteriously warm metal headband, and - strange as it sounds - a scientific grade chronometer. Oh, and a cashbox. 

Ignoring all that for a moment, we concentrated on our main target for the evening. We lifted the concrete plug holding in the pit creature, and saw that it was still there, roughly 15 feet down. After closing the plug, we assembled our load of TNT in the metal barrel, and attached a timer style detonator. Then we quickly tossed the barrel into the pit and closed the plug after it. But there was no explosion. Something had gone wrong with the plan, but we tried again, and on this second attempt we got the desired result.

As we got to the end of the alley, climbing into the getaway car, a great explosion took out the windows of the Juju House. We can only hope the blast was strong enough to kill the oily horror in the pit, but we may never know. We sped away, back toward our hotel.

We took all the loot back to our temporary lodging, arriving sometime after midnight. There, we examined them more carefully. The cashbox held personal effects of various people. We think these are wedding rings and the like, belonging to the people who were killed and made into the undead. Some of us were able to gather a few clues about the items, such as the fact that the wood sceptre's runes were Egyptian. They translated roughly to, "Nyambe the power mind". Aaron stayed up to read the stolen library book - "Africa's Dark Sects" by Nigel Blackwell. But I was exhausted and went to bed.

## Thursday January 22, 1925

Aaron told us this morning the book includes a ritual for creating the type of zombie we fought yesterday. They are called the Ciimbea. Aaron thinks he understands the ritual well enough to do it himself, but I don't understand what good that would do. The world needs no more zombies, in my estimation.

After breakfast, visited the law office of Carleton Ramsey. After bringing him up to date, we left the box of personal effects with him, along with the four severed heads from the zombies. We hope that through his connections he can track down the next-of-kin to the men whose lives were lost to make these monsters. Hopefully that will bring the families some comfort. Personally I think it might be best not to pass along the severed mutilated heads, now with point-blank bullet wounds.

I've decided this feathered robe might as well get some use, especially in the current cold spell, so I decided to wear it around today. Besides, maybe it will help flush out some hiding cultists for us to bring to justice.

I wanted to return to my lab in Philly, but rather than taking the train, Kenny offered to drive. So we set out on the highway, along with Jerry. I sat in the back seat and used the time to read "Africa's Dark Sects" for myself, and I think I regret it now. Merely reading the book cast an evil spell over me, dirtying my soul in some way. I urgently jumped out the back seat of the car, ripped off my clothes on the side of the road, and bathed in handfuls of snow. That's what Kenny and Gentleman Jerry say, any ways. I don't remember a thing about it, and came to my senses shivering in the car just a few miles from my Philadelphia apartment.

Once we got to my place, we had some hot coffee, I ran a bath, and then I changed into some clean clothes. Then I took the metal headband into the lab. I analyzed it in every way I knew how, but could not find a scientific explanation for its inner warmth. It doesn't seem to be radioactive, and doesn't seem to be undergoing any chemical reaction. It is a mystery. I did find that it is made of an atypical amalgam of metals, but that doesn't explain the faint heat it emits. While I had it on the table, I examined the writing on the headband, but can't make anything of it. I think it's cuneiform runes, but I can't read them, nor can Jerry or Kenny. Truly mysterious.

I left the scientific chronometer in my lab, and the three of us headed to the south part of town for sandwiches. One vendor there sells hot beef sandwiches with melted cheese. It's quite a delicious combination. I have a hunch these will become popular one day.
