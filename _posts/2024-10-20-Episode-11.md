# Journal


## Tuesday January 20, 1925


### From the journal of Lawrence Simons

#### A productive morning

This morning, I developed the photographs taken in the basement below Ju Ju House. They all came out OK, though paper and silver nitrate can't really do the subjects justice.

Stig is feeling ill today, and Aaron is dealing with some family business. So Jerry, Kenny, and I continue the investigations without them. 

Kenny made a few phone calls and was able to arrange a meeting with Miss Carlyle at the Carlyle Mansion, scheduled for tomorrow 11am. We also telephoned the Harvard Library and learned a few details about the missing book. I've gotta say the invention of the telephone makes this sort of work so much easier.

The missing book was "Africa's Dark Sects" published 1920 by Nigel Blackwell. We learned from the Harvard librarian that when it went missing, there was a notably rotten smell in that section of the library. Maybe the thief needed a bath, or maybe they're just a zombie. The book is uncommon. There was a limited print run. And some copies of it have been burned. That's all we learned.

#### All I wanted was a sandwich, just one sandwich

Around noon, we wandered the streets of New York looking for another one of those "Reuben" sandwiches. While out, we realized we were being followed by a thug. So Jerry ducked into a corner, while Kenny and I continued toward the park on the shore. Jerry was able to pursue unnoticed, following our follower. At some point, Jerry noticed a gang of toughs following along the original guy. Then things turned nasty.

The thugs were armed - some with guns and some with clubs. And a fight broke out. In the end, three of them ran off, one died, and one was rendered unconscious. We took the dead thug's stuff, and stuffed the living thug into the back of a cab. After a short ride, we got out in Central Park, and interrogated him. Or I guess I should say we tried to interrogate him. But we didn't get any useful information, and he suicided on an inconveniently placed knife in the eye. Searching the body, we found that he had a panga - the same kind of shortsword-like blade that has been associated with other cultists. I got a photo of the now-dead hostage, so maybe we can figure out who he was later. I suspect he was a member of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, given the panga.

#### Book shopping and another gun fight

We continued to search used bookstores for books on African sects, and we did find one that mentioned the symbol that had been carved into Jackson's head. It is the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. That cult, the book said, was originally in Egypt, but then moved to Kenya. We bought the book, in hopes it'll have information that could help us deal with this cult in the future.

We then returned to our hotel. But on arriving, the hotel detective told us that we have been moved to other rooms. At roughly the same time as we were fighting thugs by the shore, Stig and Aaron had a gun fight of their own. Apparently they won, just like we did. So someone is onto us, and wants us dead. We don't know for sure who is behind this, but they know where we're staying.

Given that, we paid the hotel for another week in advance, and then snuck out the back. Then we checked into another hotel under fake names. If all went well, anyone following us will think we are still in the original hotel.

I hope Jackson is OK with us using his money to rent two hotels at the same time. I think he would approve us this cautious approach. In fact, if he thought to lay false trails, he would be alive today.


## Wednesday January 21, 1925

After waking and getting cleaned up, we visited the Carlyle Estate. Bradley Grey is Erica Carlyle's lawyer, and apparently also her social secretary in some sense. She agreed to talk to us on the condition that we don't mention her family without her approval. I think she's afraid we're going to finish Jackson's book, when all we really want is to break his murderers to justice.

We learned there's some sort of secret related to a Negro woman named Bunet (did I spell that right?). Bunet was a priestess, according to Roger. Oh, and Roger has a collection of weird books kept in a lock box in the family library. Erica invited us to her upcoming Eclipse Party at the Carlyle Estate, and then gave us access to the library for the afternoon. She went through an elaborate ritual to open the secret shelves where Roger's special books are hidden. There are four of them.
