# Journal


## From the journal of Lawrence Simons


### Wednesday, February 18th, 1925

Jerry, Larry, and Stig went to the Blue Pyramid club to meet Zahra. We learned about 2/3 of the clientele are Egyptian, as are the wait staff. Miss Zahra filled us in on some details about Egypt. They had a revolution recently, in 1919, and is partially an English colony at the moment. The English control the canal and all the good parts of the country, but leave the locals to run the bad parts. There was a female dancer at the Blue Pyramid, dancing for tips, as well as a house band, and bouncers. Zahra turned us on to Turkish coffee, and then left after about an hour.

The three of us checked out the rest of the area. There's a drawing room, and a coffee room used for playing chess. We spotted a few other ex-military patrons, but in the end there was nothing too unusual about the place. So after a few drinks, we peacefully returned to our hotel.

### Thursday, February 19, 1925

Early in the day, we received a telephone call from the Penhew Foundation. Our request for a meeting with Mr. Gavigan will be granted at three o'clock this afternoon.

The rest of the morning we spent doing some shopping. During a stop at a top notch haberdasher, I purchased an authentic red fez. I think it's fetching.

We then proceeded to meet Gavigan. He explained that he met Elias only one time as part of researching his book on the Carlyle Expedition. We asked several questions about Africa, cults, the Egyptian Murders, and so on. But on every front, Mr. Gavigan had no useful leads for us. So we said our good-bye and left.

### Friday, February 20, 1925

We briefly reviewed our pile of documents to see if there were other leads here in London that we should be following up on. Nothing stood out at first, so we decided it's time to move on. We bought tickets for our group - now known as *International Supernatural Investigations* - to Nairobi. We will be traveling by ship, and the whole journey should take roughly two weeks.

On the way back from the travel agency, we realized we're being followed. Jerry confronted the tail, and fortunately the tail survived. I don't think we learned who sent him or why, however. We then stopped at a book store so I could get a recent printing of **Tourist Guide to Kenya**. This should keep me occupied on the steam ship journey, which will be good because I don't know a damn thing about the country. This will be my first time in Africa, and I think the same goes for most of the rest of our group. Kenny, of course, has a home in Cairo. And I'm embarrassed to say I don't know whether we will go through Cairo or not. But I'm sure there's a full itinerary in the travel plan documents we purchased.

Later, as if by divine insight, we remembered several clues we had completely forgotten about. Since we have four more days before departure, we're going to pursue some of those.


### Planning for our journey

A question came up recently of what skills I'd like to improve during the two-week journey to Nairobi.

First, I'd like to read my tourist guide cover-to-cover. [I don't think there is a skill for general tourist knowledge of a location, though]

Then, I'd to focus on improving my ability to repair mechanical devices (**Mech. Repair**). My plan is to befriend the ship's engineer and see if there are any projects I can help him with - fixing some of the menagerie of little things that break down due to life on a ship. I'm imagining things like electric motors, cargo lifts, passengers' cameras, ventilation fans and ducts, etc.


## Gentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and Musings

### Jerry's List of Leads

Here is a list of things Jerry realized later we should follow up on:

> I am not sure I am ready to give up on these Egyptian murders "just yet".
> 
> * We never circled back to Mahooney at the small, independent newspaper.
> * We never looked into the victims beyond cause of death (BFT + knife to heart).
> * We never interview victims' families (unless they had none in London, i.e. a political attache stationed here).
> * We never visited the sites of any of the murders.
> 
> Remember all the good info we got from the guys on death row's wife and neighborhood watch friend?


## A Longer List of Clues

As if by divine intervention, the stalwart but forgetful fellows of *International Supernatural Investigations* assembled this list of clues late one night in the hotel, reviewing all their past notes.

Edited and reformatted for easier reading

Some handouts are marked with (( )) around them, those are ones the group has followed to a logical end.

### Letter from Jackson Elias

```
Greetings from beyond the grave!

  By now you know that all I've really left you is a 
whole heap of trouble. If I were still around to have an
opinion on the matter, I would understand if you decided 
to walk away from it all. Hell, if I'm dead right now,
that's a good indication I should have done the same.
But you know me too well, and I know you too well. If
you were the kind of person who always did the sensible
thing we wouldn't be such good friends.

  You have been there when I needed you in the past
and I hope you will be again, even if it's too late to
save me. I've been pulling threads all over the world
and while most of them are still unravelling I think
I'm onto something big.  Carlton and Jonah can fill in
more of the details for you - I've left some of my papers 
and notes with them which should help you work out
which hornets' nests you need to poke next.

  I trust you to bring my killers to justice. Of course, I'm
assuming I was murdered - it will be just plain embarassing
if I was run over by a trolly car! Follow my
investigation to it's bloody end, and seek out the truth.
I'm not asking you to finish my book - none of you
can write worth a damn.

  Your friend, always,
    Jackson

### Elias' Initial Letter to Kensington [NAIROBI]

```
												August 8, 1924
												Nairobi
Dear Jonah,
  Big news! There is a possibility
that not all of the members of the Carlyle Expedition died.
I have a lead. Though the authorities here deny the cult angle,
the natives sing a different tune. You wouldn't believe the stories!
Some juicy notes coming your way!
  This one may make us all rich!
  Blood and kisses,
    J
```


### Elias' London Notes

```
Many names, many forms, but all the same and toward one end...

Need help...

Too big, too ghastly these Dreams... dreams like Carlyle's?

Check that psychoanalyst's files... All of them survived!

They'll open the gate. Why?... so the power
and the danger is real They...

Many threads beginning...

The books are in Carlyle's Safe...

Coming for me. Will the ocean protect?

Ho ho, no quitting now.  Must tell and make readers BELIEVE. Should I screm for them?
Let's scream together....
```

- Confirmed cult by checking "Sam Mariga, railway station", Neville Jermyn, Dr. Starret, Lt. Selkirk, Col. Endicott
- Notes that the reason for going to Nairobi may be from Egypt.
- Long interview tih Lt. Mark Selkirk, saying bodies were undecayed, no caucasions found

the massacre.

### 'Life as a God' fragment, reproduced here

```
Its external angles were magnificent 
and most strange; by their hideous
beauty I was enraptured and
enthralled, and I thought myself 
of the daylight fools who adjudged
the housing of this room as mistaken.
I laughed for the glory they missed.
Through the twisted door to the
jewelled throne of Darkness, I came
with all reverence and humility,
to gaze upon scenes of celestial 
majesty and rebirth. When the six lights
were lit and the great words said,
the He came, in all the grace
and splendour of the Higher
Planes, and I longed to sever my
veins so that my life might flow 
into his being, and make part of
me a god!
```

- Newspaper Clipping [ENGLAND] - Slaughter Continues! Reward offered!

### Interview with Inspector Barrington

- Elias said the murders were ritual killings conducted by the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh, which Elias described as an Egyptian Death cult.
- Barrington talked to the Penhew Foundation, meeting with Edward Gavington, who contradicted everything Elias said, saying that they had died out hundreds of years ago.  Gavington described Elias as a sensation-seeking profiteer and unlikely to be a reliable source of information.
- A total of 19 murders have been carried out over the last three years, with the same modus operandi.
- So alled "Egyptian Murders" because 17 of them were Egyptian Nationals.
- Blue Pyramid Club in Soho is often frequented by resident and visiting Egyptian businessmen, and many of the victims had frequented the club.
- He interviewed many people with connections to Egypt, mostly to no result, although a spice dealers named Zahra Shafik interested him, and she gave him the feeling there was a lot she wasn't saying.
