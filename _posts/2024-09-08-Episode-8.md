BIG APPLE DATELINE

ROGER CARLYLE the playboy whome everybody knows - or knows about - is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt!  You've seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots.  Who can doubt he'll dig up someone - er, something - equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands?

CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR LONDON

Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the British steamship Imperial Standard

Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month.

Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority.  Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyle's trademark, but he has never become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites.

Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt.

OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS

Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations.

Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable "Freudian" psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs.

Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist.  Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum.

Additional members may be secured while in London.

CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT

CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Thursday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a "well-earned rest."

Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari "in respite from our sandy labors."

Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke.

Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entire too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel.

**IMPORTANT VISITORS**

MOMBASA (Reuters)-- Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley.

Our Undersecretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are the youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Rober Huston, as well as socialite Miss Hypatia Masters.

The party leaves inland today, for Nairoby and hunting.

**CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST**

MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the possible disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months.

The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and four other American citizens, as well as Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom.

The expedition left Nairobi on August 3rd, ostensibly on safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi.
