# Journal


## Wednesday January 21, 1925 (continued)


### From the journal of Lawrence Simons

Having returned to our hotel from the Carlyle Estate, we hatched a plot made of several parts. We will equip ourselves with shovels and rakes and implements of destruction *and* as much dynamite as we can reasonably carry. And then we will return to the Juju House, beneath which lies horrors and abominations. If all goes well, we intend to blast the writhing mass of oily flesh in the pit into a million pieces, and take down the Juju House once and for all.

A trip to a hardware store outfitted us with bolt cutters, a trash barrel, coveralls, and a wheelbarrow. From there we made our way to a construction site where the foundation of a new bridge for motor cars is being excavated. It was only lightly guarded, fortunately.

Kenny and Stig, not being hardened men of action, stayed in the Cadillac, while Aaron, Jerry, and I snuck into a storage shed under cover of darkness. We successfully gathered what can only be described as an alarming amount of explosives, along with blasting caps, timers, wire, and the like.

We made our way back to Harlem, and around midnight snuck into the Juju House. After our previous incursion only two nights ago, the cult had been busy covering their tracks. They buried the entrance to the ghastly basement with dirt, and then nailed over a new floor on top, to try to hide the whole thing. Fortunately, we were able to easily re-excavate the trap door, and descend. Jerry stayed above to guard our escape and keep an eye out should the Bloody Tongue cultists try to surprise us.

On arriving in the subterranean chapel of evil, we peeked behind the curtain and once again awoke the four shambling undead that we have been calling "zombies". We soon learned they are tough buggers, as they shrug off even a lead bullet to the chest or arm. Fortunately, we came by accident upon a new and successful strategy - *aim for the head*. This is a challenge even for skilled marksmen. We downed one of the zombies this way, but then an eerie silence settled over the scene.
