# Journal

From the journal of Lawrence Simons:

## Saturday January 17, 1925

The funeral of Jackson Elias was today. It wasn't well attended - just us, Jackson's lawyer Carleton Ramsey, Ramsey's niece, and publisher Jonah Kensington. There were some reporters who stayed a respectable distance away. Jackson had no family, so had no family at the funeral. The attorney told us that the reading of the will is scheduled for Monday the 19th at Ramsey's law office.

Next we went to the Lafayette theater in Harlem to talk to Millie Adams and Rebecca Shosenberg. Millie does some work at the theater. She told us that Teddy's Saloon is where a neighborhood watch group met that included her husband Hilton Adams. This group were all former members of the [Harlem Hellfighters](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harlem-Hellfighters).

Millie imparted a few useful clues to us in our conversation.

* When bodies started appearing in Harlem, the police blamed it on drugs, on an African Death Cult, etc.
* Dr. Lemming ???
* They found a cult in Harlem with some connection to East Africa
* Ju Ju House
* Hilton was arrested over a body. The cops said he used his Army knife, but Millie said he never took it out of the house.
* The four men of the neighborhood watch are:
	* Needham Jonson
	* Douglas Fells
	* Art Mills
	* Jackie Wallace

Before we parted ways, Mrs. Adams gave us her telephone number.

Our next stop was Teddy's Saloon, but the dorman wouldn't let us in. So we went across the street and did some gambling and relaxing. After a while, Needham and Art arrived. They confirmed msot of what we think. The neighborhood watch stopped after Hilton was arrested.

Could the police or some other group be doing some crime each new moon and committing the murders themselves to drive people off the streets so there are no witnesses?

Art is a trumpeter, and led us across the street to Teddy's. We played some music, and now are welcome there in the future.


## Sunday January 18, 1925

The morning started with a train ride to Sing Sing Prison. Mrs. Adams had written a letter to Mr. Adams for us to take to him. I read the letter on the train and found an encoded message where she "signed" the message to indicate that it was authentic (I assume).

When we arrived, we met with Mr. Bronton, the warden. He said we can't hand Hilton the letter directly, but we can let him read it or we can read it to him. And then we can hand it to the warden and he'll gives it to Hilton later.

Our impression was that Hilton looks alright. He doesn't seem mistreated.

According to Hilton Adams...

* He came across the body, but the cops were already waiting for him in hiding when he arrived. Then they pounced on him.
* This seems to indicate that Hilton was framed. But of course it's his word against the police.
* He had found mention of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue with some connection to Juju House.
* There was a muscular shaven-headed African guy, M'Kunga Mukugna (or something like that).

Speculation: Maybe the cops are being paid by Juju House.

Speculation: The red ribbon on the goons who killed Jackson Elias could be the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.

After returning to New York City, we briefly looked at the crime scene to see if we could find a curved knife that had been overlooked or discarded somewhere. But no luck. 

Next up:

* visit Juju House
* the reading of the will
