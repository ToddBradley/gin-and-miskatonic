# Journal


## From the journal of Lawrence Simons


### Tuesday, February 24, 1925

* We were in the factory, trying to get into the safe. But we had no key. We learned that Frank the foreman has the key. So how do we get it from him? Such a mystery! What's in the large safe!
* We explored around some more and found some blueprints of two types. The first was just typical stuff that the factory here in Derby had made - household items, etc. The second type was more interesting. The blueprints were really complicated tiny things with occult symbols. I couldn't figure out what these were for. I decided to take the blueprints with me, in hopes I can decipher them later. So into my messenger bag they went.
* And then shit got weird. Jerry was wandering around outside, and got attacked by a tentacle from the sky. There is some huge flying creature above us! What is it?
* I untied the guard, and told him he is allowed to go use the WC now. I led him outside of the main factory building, toward the WC. The tentacle creature attacked him and ripped him in half. I got something of a view of the thing. It was a black serpent with bat like wings. The thing we thought was a tentacle at first was actually the thing's tail!
* I shot the creature with my shotgun, and it hissed at me before I ducked back into the building.
* Did the creature leave? We didn't know. But I realized we had a working telephone. So I decided to call Frank the foreman, in hopes I could trick him to coming down to the factory so we could steal the key to the safe. But it didn't work. Some other guy answered the phone, and made it clear that he and Frank knew we were here. They had been warned by Gavigan, who is also here. Gavigan is behind the flying creature, we learned.
* So we waited it out, thinking surely the thing will disappear before day breaks. We spotted a very nice car at the gate. 
* I used the phone again to call Scotland Yard, in hopes we could get Inspector Barrington out of bed and activated to come arrest Gavigan.
* But then, some unknown person arrived to talk to the person in the car, who we think is probably Gavigan. And shortly after, the man cut the phone line. Now it's just us.
* Time passed, and Jerry had the idea to use the power tools in the shop to drill open the safe. It took hours, but eventually we got in. The safe had very strange things inside. First were a set of tiny devices embedded in rock. They looked like some ancient civilization created advanced engine mechanics of some kind, and then those pieces of machinery were buried with mud that fossilized. That would mean the mechanisms were millions of years old! This made no sense. The other set of things were similar tiny devices that looked like they had been manufactured recently, right here in the machine shop.
* We loaded up all these items into some bags, and snuck out the back with the gizmos - both old and new.
* Time passed. We eventually made our way back to London and explained everything to Barrington. We stayed out of sight, since clearly Gavigan has it out for us and could strike at any time.
* Next, we leave for Kenya.
