Yesterday, Jerry called Rebecca Shoshenberg to fill her in on our latest findings, and the fact that we’ve turned over evidence to police Lt. Poole that should prove Hilton Adams innocent of the crime he is imprisoned for.We all got dressed in our finest, suitable for a society party at the Carlyle Mansion. I made sure to take the bank check with us. On arriving, that was my first order of business - really the only order of business. Erica decided she would agree to our offer, and so I handed over the check to Mr. Gray, the lawyer.But just as Miss Carlyle opened the safe to hand over her brother’s books, intruders arrived! It was a tall black guy with a shaved head - the one we’ve been warned about - and two of his henchmen. We later learned the cultist brute is Mukunga M’Dari. He demanded the books, and Aaron drew a gun and ordered him to stay where he was.As one might predict, the thugs did not follow orders, and a fight ensued. Billy clubs and firearms. Where is Gentleman Jerry, our ace-up-the-sleeve boxing champion? He was outside, but quickly responded at the sound of gunfire. During the melee, it became clear that this whole thing had been planned, and several members of the catering staff were actually hired thugs. We put down M’Dari, but his henchmen manhandled Miss Carlyle out the back door into the yard.Jerry and Aaron pursued on foot, while I tried to formulate a quick response plan with the Carlyle security head, and Kenny got his doctor bag out of the car. It was clear we were going to need it.By the time Kenny and I regrouped, the cultists had dragged Miss Carlyle down an unused path into the woods. I made a snap judgment to pursue by motor sleigh, because of course there was one in the stable. Aaron drove as best and fast as he could, while I readied a shotgun I took from a gun rack in the stable.A mile or two into the woods, we found there was a clearing, and in the clearing was an altar. It then became clear the Cult of the Bloody Tongue planned to sacrifice Miss Erica Carlyle herself at the moment of the eclipse. They set all this up in advance! And there was the Bloody Tongue ringleader himself, the elderly Silas N’Kwame, proprietor of the Juju House (now defunct). There were also three more cultists dressed in Bloody Tongue attire, ready for the horrible ceremony.Kenny and I rolled up on the motor sleigh at great speed. I shot one of the cultists with the shotgun, then rolled off into a snowbank, shouting to Kenny, “Ram speed!” He got the hint, and gunned the engine, heading straight for Silas. Unfortunately, his driving isn’t as good as his doctoring, and it was just a glancing blow that left the motor sleigh on its side and Kenny on the ground.More fighting ensued. Jerry chopped off Silas’ hand, which caused the old man to pass out. But the cultists didn’t quit. They were still trying to tie Erica down and perform the ceremony. But once I shot one of them point blank with the shotgun, the rest ran off into the trees.We saved Erica, and the two thugs were eventually picked up by the police. Needless to say, Erica was extremely grateful.Over the next few days, she pulled a few high society strings to accelerate the review of the Adams’ case, and got him sprung from Sing Sing. And we got Roger’s books under better circumstances. This wrapped up many loose ends, and we felt a great sense of accomplishment.Our next destination, we decided, will be England. We plan to follow in the footsteps of the original Carlyle Expedition, and see what clues we can find along the way that might explain what really happened. So we started to prepare to leave the United States for what will likely be several months. After England, we plan to go to Cairo, and then eventually to Kenya.And that’s the end of the American chapter of our quest.[Out of character: We got a total of 12 Sanity points back for all the things we accomplished. We’ll get more skill points later.]" }, { "title": "Episode 14 - Boom - January 12, 2025", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-14/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-01-12 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper Bringer of torment and delights Todd Lawrence “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor, saxophonist, and engineer Eric Father Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Catholic priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Eli Dr. Kenneth Filmore Wealthy medical doctor and neurosurgeon Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Scott Ritter Gunter “Stig” von Stiglitz Former German POW JournalFrom the journal of Lawrence SimonsWednesday January 21, 1925 (continued)Once we found the figurative Achille’s heel of the zombies, we dispatched the other three in short order by aiming for the head. With the last one gone, something of a calm came over the obcene underground cult chapel. But then we heard movement in the pit.We found a ton of cult stuff behind the curtain - a cult robe, lion claws, the missing book (that Harvard librarian will be so pleased), a weird four-faced mask, another bloody tongue headband, a scepter, a fancy feathered robe, a bowl, a mysteriously warm metal headband, and - strange as it sounds - a scientific grade chronometer. Oh, and a cashbox.Ignoring all that for a moment, we concentrated on our main target for the evening. We lifted the concrete plug holding in the pit creature, and saw that it was still there, roughly 15 feet down. After closing the plug, we assembled our load of TNT in the metal barrel, and attached a timer style detonator. Then we quickly tossed the barrel into the pit and closed the plug after it. But there was no explosion. Something had gone wrong with the plan, but we tried again, and on this second attempt we got the desired result.As we got to the end of the alley, climbing into the getaway car, a great explosion took out the windows of the Juju House. We can only hope the blast was strong enough to kill the oily horror in the pit, but we may never know. We sped away, back toward our hotel.We took all the loot back to our temporary lodging, arriving sometime after midnight. There, we examined them more carefully. The cashbox held personal effects of various people. We think these are wedding rings and the like, belonging to the people who were killed and made into the undead. Some of us were able to gather a few clues about the items, such as the fact that the wood sceptre’s runes were Egyptian. They translated roughly to, “Nyambe the power mind”. Aaron stayed up to read the stolen library book - “Africa’s Dark Sects” by Nigel Blackwell. But I was exhausted and went to bed.Thursday January 22, 1925Aaron told us this morning the book includes a ritual for creating the type of zombie we fought yesterday. They are called the Ciimbea. Aaron thinks he understands the ritual well enough to do it himself, but I don’t understand what good that would do. The world needs no more zombies, in my estimation.After breakfast, visited the law office of Carleton Ramsey. After bringing him up to date, we left the box of personal effects with him, along with the four severed heads from the zombies. We hope that through his connections he can track down the next-of-kin to the men whose lives were lost to make these monsters. Hopefully that will bring the families some comfort. Personally I think it might be best not to pass along the severed mutilated heads, now with point-blank bullet wounds.I’ve decided this feathered robe might as well get some use, especially in the current cold spell, so I decided to wear it around today. Besides, maybe it will help flush out some hiding cultists for us to bring to justice.I wanted to return to my lab in Philly, but rather than taking the train, Kenny offered to drive. So we set out on the highway, along with Jerry. I sat in the back seat and used the time to read “Africa’s Dark Sects” for myself, and I think I regret it now. Merely reading the book cast an evil spell over me, dirtying my soul in some way. I urgently jumped out the back seat of the car, ripped off my clothes on the side of the road, and bathed in handfuls of snow. That’s what Kenny and Gentleman Jerry say, any ways. I don’t remember a thing about it, and came to my senses shivering in the car just a few miles from my Philadelphia apartment.Once we got to my place, we had some hot coffee, I ran a bath, and then I changed into some clean clothes. Then I took the metal headband into the lab. I analyzed it in every way I knew how, but could not find a scientific explanation for its inner warmth. It doesn’t seem to be radioactive, and doesn’t seem to be undergoing any chemical reaction. It is a mystery. I did find that it is made of an atypical amalgam of metals, but that doesn’t explain the faint heat it emits. While I had it on the table, I examined the writing on the headband, but can’t make anything of it. I think it’s cuneiform runes, but I can’t read them, nor can Jerry or Kenny. Truly mysterious.I left the scientific chronometer in my lab, and the three of us headed to the south part of town for sandwiches. One vendor there sells hot beef sandwiches with melted cheese. It’s quite a delicious combination. I have a hunch these will become popular one day.Gentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsWednesday, January 21st, 1925As best as I could make out by the shouting, Kenny hit one of the Beasties, Larry and Aaron shot one dead. Stig had used a spear to pin one against the wall, like a butterfly on a bulletin board. Quickly, all four lie upon the stone ground, unmoving. I carefully crept down the narrow stairs - not engineered to accommodate shoulders like mine - and used my fireman’s axe to chop off the four heads, stuffing them into a sack. Grisly, to be sure, but I think the next of kin might gain some closure from knowing these four were truly gone.Back behind the curtain we found quite a haul of items. A fancy feathered ceremonial robe (amusingly, Skinny Larry put it on). A pair of strap-on Lion’s Claws hanging from a hook. A very attractive Chronometer, set to GMT time. A Leopard-skin blanket that wrapped some of the stuff. Another Bloody Tongue Mask with an actual human tongue. A hideous wicker basket helmet (mask) atop which sat four hideous faces … one carved to be sort of “melty”, one female, all with African features. Stig thinks they look like they are from the Congo. I couldn’t even place the Congo on a map.The loot also contained the missing library book - Africa’s Dark Sects, from the Harvard (Wiedner) Library. A burnished copper bowl. A scepter carved from hardwood and decorated with runes (“Nyambi, They power mine” - a south/west African Deity). A headband made of dull gray metal, etched with runes that someone mumbled were “Kiniform”-like. I’m too stupid to know what that even is, but I didn’t let on.It notably felt warm to the touch. Larry thinks it is radioactive and wants to Geiger-counter it.What else? Oh yeah, a cash-box containing what seemed to be a pile of personal effects from those that were … uh … animated (and I bet also from the poor devils that were added to the faces of the oily ooze under the stone plug). An engraved pocket watch, a wedding band, and a pair of reading glasses. I bet they were those things called “Fetishes” that kept the walking dead under control. The box also contained a fair amount of coin. Proceeds from the Ju-Ju House item sales?The book - probably the best part of the booty - was written by Nigel Blackwell, authored in 1920, no production house listed. It was a sort of travel log and expose of a variety of African Cults. It also detailed a ritual for creating the Walking Dead. I think I heard that they’re called “Ciimba” or something. I bet the author is in a padded cell somewhere, blubbering and sobbing. This kinda stuff takes a toll on a man’s sanity. Glad I’ve got the Armor of our Lord and Savior.I wonder what sort of late fee Miriam Atwright would levy, upon its return to the library.It took two tries but we blew up the thing under the stone plug that had been hideously shrieking the whole time. May the souls it consumed find peace everlasting, Amen. It was an admirable explosion, sundering glass windows and wooden shingles and shaking buildings a block away. My friends are really good at what they do. I’m glad to know them. Back to the second (secret) hotel for some shut-eye. Too late for a Pastrami on Rye, that’ll have to wait until tomorrow. Thursday, January 22nd, 1925We tossed some ideas back and forth regarding the sack ‘o heads, and decided to give them to Carlton Ramsey, Jackson Elias’ attorney and handler of his estate. We popped over at 11 AM. The idea was he’d pass them (and all the loot) to that good Police Captain (Martin Poole), not the one in Harlem (Captain Hobson), and the mix of items might at least provide evidence supporting a stay of execution (Hilton Adams). It is likely something - maybe the brass money clip - belonged to one of the Harlem residents that disappeared after Hilton was incarcerated. Was it one of the four Zombies? I don’t know.Me and Larry hitched a ride with Kenny to Philly, to visit Larry’s lab. Larry really likes that feathered cloak, struttin’ around town like a … I don’t know … spiritual leader of some ancient sacrificial cult or something. If that shaven-headed African sees us (Mukunga Madari), it might coerce him to attack us.He wanted some light reading, so like Aaron, he read the Dark Sects book. Then he got a crazy look in his eyes and jumped out of the car on the parkway doing 60! Kenny slowed down when the blast of cold air from the open door hit him. I tried to grab Larry, but he was intent on his demise, so I wrapped my arms around him to form a protective cocoon of sorts and rolled with him, pell-mell down the embankment. If I hadn’t gotten all tangled up in the seatbelt I might have stopped him.As I had hoped, I took the brunt of the gravel and jagged ice as we tumbled. Poor guy was trying to cleanse himself of the Zombie encounter, rubbing himself with snow. Crazy stuff. I prayed with him all the while, until he regained his senses, shivering. Kenny wrapped him in an Army blanket and we took off before the Jersey Troopers caught wind of our escapades.I tinkered with the Chronometer (no wind-up mechanism) while Larry determined the composition of the headband was a mix or blend of common metals. It was not Radioactive. So why was it warm?It occurred to me as I rested on Larry’s couch (both of us had been patched up by Kenny, my Thick Leather Priest’s Frock was pocked with sharp gravel) that we should call that pretty reporter (Rebecca Shosenburg) and make good on our promise to loop her in with regard to any progress on the Hilton Adams affair. I bet Larry has her phone number. She was pretty sure Adams was innocent." }, { "title": "Episode 13 - Return to Juju, Part 1 - December 15, 2024", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-13/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-12-15 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper Bringer of torment and delights Todd Lawrence “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor, saxophonist, and engineer Eric Father Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Catholic priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Eli Dr. Kenneth Filmore Wealthy medical doctor and neurosurgeon Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Scott Ritter Gunter “Stig” von Stiglitz Former German POW JournalWednesday January 21, 1925 (continued)From the journal of Lawrence SimonsHaving returned to our hotel from the Carlyle Estate, we hatched a plot made of several parts. We will equip ourselves with shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and as much dynamite as we can reasonably carry. And then we will return to the Juju House, beneath which lies horrors and abominations. If all goes well, we intend to blast the writhing mass of oily flesh in the pit into a million pieces, and take down the Juju House once and for all.A trip to a hardware store outfitted us with bolt cutters, a trash barrel, coveralls, and a wheelbarrow. From there we made our way to a construction site where the foundation of a new bridge for motor cars is being excavated. It was only lightly guarded, fortunately.Kenny and Stig, not being hardened men of action, stayed in the Cadillac, while Aaron, Jerry, and I snuck into a storage shed under cover of darkness. We successfully gathered what can only be described as an alarming amount of explosives, along with blasting caps, timers, wire, and the like.We made our way back to Harlem, and around midnight snuck into the Juju House. After our previous incursion only two nights ago, the cult had been busy covering their tracks. They buried the entrance to the ghastly basement with dirt, and then nailed over a new floor on top, to try to hide the whole thing. Fortunately, we were able to easily re-excavate the trap door, and descend. Jerry stayed above to guard our escape and keep an eye out should the Bloody Tongue cultists try to surprise us.On arriving in the subterranean chapel of evil, we peeked behind the curtain and once again awoke the four shambling undead that we have been calling “zombies”. We soon learned they are tough buggers, as they shrug off even a lead bullet to the chest or arm. Fortunately, we came by accident upon a new and successful strategy - aim for the head. This is a challenge even for skilled marksmen. We downed one of the zombies this way, but then an eerie silence settled over the scene.To Be ContinuedGentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsMy companions REALLY want to blow up the basement of that African Shop - The Ju-Ju House. And I find once they make up their minds, no amount of discussion will bend them. Hell, I like a nice fiery ‘splosion as well as the next guy, so we figured out a few ways to get our hands on some TNT, dynamite, unexploded ordnance, and the like.We grabbed our trusty, oiled bolt-cutters, acquired some denim coveralls, and loaded an empty oil drum and wheelbarrow into Kenny’s rear cargo seat of that beautiful car of his. We lit out for a construction site next to the Hudson River (we could make out the profile of Sing-Sing, I think). A fabricated office … more of a shed with power … seemed to hold a night guard, who we saw silhouetted by a bare light bulb within, as we cruised by, slowly.We also made out a storage shed, which must contain whatever the crew uses to get through the rock, to sink the bollards for the bridge being constructed. Its sturdy door faced the occupied office shed.The chain link security fence surrounding the area did not extend into the river, so we stepped around it, briefly navigating the frozen river where it touched the shore. Me and Aaron and Larry crept up to the rear of the shed, but the ground had been thawing by day and refreezing by night, and was slick as Hell. We won’t talk about my pal that fell into the wheelbarrow, dumping the metal oil drum upon the rocky ground with a clatter so loud that the night watchman opened the door and peered out with his lantern. We dropped to the ground and discovered he must have a small transistor radio, to help pass the time.To make a long story short, we popped the rivets of a section of corrugated metal forming the storage shed’s rear wall and slipped away with a drum full of bags of powder. We pushed the loose wall section back into place and shored it up from the outside; Aaron had shifted the remaining contents to “even out” the empty spot indicating our theft.Rejoining Stig and Kenny was easy, and rather than storing the blasting powder in Kenny’s nice wheels overnight we decided quickly among ourselves to pay another visit to the Ju-Ju house. As my pals carried the bag or two of powder first into the vacant Pawn Shop (which we left with the padlock in place but not engaged), then into the African Curiosities Shop, I ambled down the street two blocks to pay a quick visit to the Catholic Church. I said a few Ave Marias and Hail Marys, lit a candle, and dropped a few dimes into the poor box, before tipping my hat to the Priest and joining the fun in the cul-de-sac. As before I sort of hung out at the street entrance to the alley, rolling and lighting a smoke (to tell the truth, I fully expected the shave-headed African to be lying in wait nearby). After a minute or two, I entered the shop where my companions were busy pulling up floorboards and sundering a shallow sill full of dirt that hid the narrow stone steps, down. Neat trick for the unaware. Downstairs, my pals tempted fate a second time, engaging the four zombies behind the solid door whose hinge pins we had popped two days ago (seems like much longer). The big stone plug covered the oily whatever-it-is in its pit, and as I hid next to the end of a shelf of ceramic jars and feathered drums and little strings of beads to ensure no one interrupted our little excursion from the rear, I heard gunfire below. I made out “Aim for the head!”, and knew they had found a weakness of the walking dead, with the exposed loops of intestines and ritually scarred foreheads.I slid two ceremonial (but serviceable) spears down the narrow steps and could just make out the powder bags at their base. Flickering light, rather than a solid flashlight strobe, told me the guys were lighting fires down there … for light I suppose … nasty business." }, { "title": "Episode 12 - Lots About Books - November 17, 2024", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-12/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-11-17 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper Bringer of torment and delights Todd Lawrence “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor, saxophonist, and engineer Eric Father Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Catholic priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Eli Dr. Kenneth Filmore Wealthy medical doctor and neurosurgeon Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter “Stig” von Stiglitz Former German POW JournalWednesday January 21, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsHard to believe it’s only been 6 days since Jackson Elias died. It feels like we’ve been in the Carlyle Library half that time, but it’s only been a few hours. Of the 4 books Erica has been holding on to for Roger, 3 are in English and 1 is in French. Since I can’t read French, I decided to browse through The Pnakotic Manuscript. It had a couple of rituals described - some might call them “spells” - Contact Winged One and Contact Mind of the Observer. Skimming this book made me think about some things I’m not sure are good for normal folks to know about.I think with good light, I could take a photograph of the pages of the rituals, but I don’t believe I will. It’s just as well that knowledge stay here in the Carlyle Library. My comrades also read through one book each. We didn’t really find any great clues, but we all agree Robert had unusual reading interests.Making a list of loose ends we ought to follow up on: the upcoming eclipse party Miss Bunay, the mysterious African companion of Roger Carlyle who doesn’t appear in any photos and has some sort of East African accent personal backgrounds of the other principals of the Carlyle Expedition Jack Brady was Roger’s bodyguard and friend; he served in the US Marines in Shanghai during the Great WarAfter leaving the Carlyle Estate, we visited a bookstore to try to learn the value of Robert’s book. We think we’d like to make Erica an offer for them. Pricing the books was hard to do, though, because they’re so unusual. To the right person, they could be worth a fortune, but to most people they’re just crazy pulp.In the end, we telephoned the Carlyles and made a verbal offer to Mr. Gray that we could pay Miss Carlyle $2500 for the books, and keep their transfer a secret. We think she’ll go for it, but don’t know. That’s all the money we can afford, according to Mr. Carlton Ramsey, the keeper of our funds.Gentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsAs we helped ourselves to the finger sandwiches proffered by Erica’s servants, we translated portions of the French tome. We also did a pretty thorough search for the book that was missing from the Harvard Library - “African Dark Sects” - to no avail. I made it a point to riffle most of the books in the private collection, hoping to find a hidden sheaf of looseleaf paper. Again, we came up empty.All the while we sat beneath the steady eyes of Bradley Gray, as Erica was off preparing for the upcoming Eclipse Party.We discovered a pair of Rituals - described to me as similar to a recipe you would find in a cookbook. “Contact Winged One” (five pages) “Contact Mind of the Observer” (four pages)Oh, one of the books was actually named, “Pnakotic Manuscripts”.Some information about another book: “Life as a God” - authored by Montgomery Crompton. Psychotic Ravings from Egypt, 1805 - he considered himself a Minor Priest of the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh.“Among the Stones” - a book of Poetry in English. Eh - I didn’t care much for it.“Libre Ebonis” - this seems to be a complete book (in French) where we had found a badly burned copy in English (in the haunted Rental home with the corpse in the basement, where Aaron stabbed me). That one was called “Livre ‘d Ebon” or something. It was in pretty poor condition. It described a thing called, “Tsathoggueque”, worshipped as a deity, and was full of spells and depictions of an upside-down Ankh.The party was at nine in the morning on Saturday. Huh. I thought since it was an ECLIPSE PARTY, that it would be at night with the moon in view. Anyway, I hid my pistol behind a grate in the swimming pool’s dusty pumphouse. Erica described certain of the failed expedition. Miss Bunny’s first name was Nichonga, from East Africa. Jack Brady, the bodyguard, an American, was stationed in Shanghai while in the military. Hypatia Masters, the photographer. Justin Jeffrey wrote an early version of “Life as a God” - named “People of the Monolith”We offered a tidy sum of $2500 for these volumes, with a promise to keep them secret and hidden from nihilists and cult members. This stretched Elias’ funds pretty thin." }, { "title": "Episode 11 - Sandwiches, Goons, and Books - October 20, 2024", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-11/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-10-20 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper Bringer of torment and delights Todd Lawrence “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor, saxophonist, and engineer Eric Father Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Catholic priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Eli Dr. Kenneth Filmore Wealthy medical doctor and neurosurgeon Not Present Player Character Background Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Scott Ritter Gunter “Stig” von Stiglitz Former German POW JournalTuesday January 20, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsA productive morningThis morning, I developed the photographs taken in the basement below Ju Ju House. They all came out OK, though paper and silver nitrate can’t really do the subjects justice.Stig is feeling ill today, and Aaron is dealing with some family business. So Jerry, Kenny, and I continue the investigations without them.Kenny made a few phone calls and was able to arrange a meeting with Miss Carlyle at the Carlyle Mansion, scheduled for tomorrow 11am. We also telephoned the Harvard Library and learned a few details about the missing book. I’ve gotta say the invention of the telephone makes this sort of work so much easier.The missing book was “Africa’s Dark Sects” published 1920 by Nigel Blackwell. We learned from the Harvard librarian that when it went missing, there was a notably rotten smell in that section of the library. Maybe the thief needed a bath, or maybe they’re just a zombie. The book is uncommon. There was a limited print run. And some copies of it have been burned. That’s all we learned.All I wanted was a sandwich, just one sandwichAround noon, we wandered the streets of New York looking for another one of those “Reuben” sandwiches. While out, we realized we were being followed by a thug. So Jerry ducked into a corner, while Kenny and I continued toward the park on the shore. Jerry was able to pursue unnoticed, following our follower. At some point, Jerry noticed a gang of toughs following along the original guy. Then things turned nasty.The thugs were armed - some with guns and some with clubs. And a fight broke out. In the end, three of them ran off, one died, and one was rendered unconscious. We took the dead thug’s stuff, and stuffed the living thug into the back of a cab. After a short ride, we got out in Central Park, and interrogated him. Or I guess I should say we tried to interrogate him. But we didn’t get any useful information, and he suicided on an inconveniently placed knife in the eye. Searching the body, we found that he had a panga - the same kind of shortsword-like blade that has been associated with other cultists. I got a photo of the now-dead hostage, so maybe we can figure out who he was later. I suspect he was a member of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, given the panga.Book shopping and another gun fightWe continued to search used bookstores for books on African sects, and we did find one that mentioned the symbol that had been carved into Jackson’s head. It is the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. That cult, the book said, was originally in Egypt, but then moved to Kenya. We bought the book, in hopes it’ll have information that could help us deal with this cult in the future.We then returned to our hotel. But on arriving, the hotel detective told us that we have been moved to other rooms. At roughly the same time as we were fighting thugs by the shore, Stig and Aaron had a gun fight of their own. Apparently they won, just like we did. So someone is onto us, and wants us dead. We don’t know for sure who is behind this, but they know where we’re staying.Given that, we paid the hotel for another week in advance, and then snuck out the back. Then we checked into another hotel under fake names. If all went well, anyone following us will think we are still in the original hotel.I hope Jackson is OK with us using his money to rent two hotels at the same time. I think he would approve us this cautious approach. In fact, if he thought to lay false trails, he would be alive today.Gentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsLarry developed some of the photographs that he had snapped of the Zombies and the Black-Oily-Fleshy-Multi-Faced thing. Stig was feeling ill and Aaron was off handling some family business but would be back soon.We had but one item on the docket, we seemed to be reaching an impasse and really needed some breakthrough leads before we started gallivanting across the globe half-cocked. The meeting with Erica, Carlysle’s sister, was to occur on Wednesday (the 21st) at 11 o’ clock. A Mr Bradley Gray, her secretary - no, strike that - her lawyer - scheduled the meeting, as we leveraged the good Doctor’s (Kenny, our new cohort) social connections.Instead of burning precious daylight traveling by rail to the Harvard University Library, we phoned the Weidner Library and were connected to one Miriam Atright, who divulged the details of the missing tome! It was titled “Africa’s Dark Sects” and about the shelf from where it was missing, a disgusting odor of rot pervaded. It was one of a limited print run, many copies of which had been destroyed (burned), and was published in 1920 and penned by Nigel Blackwell.We put a thumbtack on this, intending to visit a few local used bookstores to see if we could “luck into” a copy.After a wonderful and unexpectedly filling Pastrami on Rye (maybe it was the crisp Dill Pickle I ordered on the side?), as we strolled down the street we noticed we had picked up a tail - a nondescript, unshaven bum in a worn jacket. When we stopped to look into a shop window, he stopped too, about half a block or so back. He had dark blonde hair and smoked.We decided to play a game of tail-the-tail, so when the three of us interweaved with a group of oncoming pedestrians, I quickly ducked into a second-hand clothing store, grabbed a shabby, plaid blazer off of a hanger, slapped a quarter on the counter with an apology, and slid into it.When I saw the tail pass by, I slipped back out, behind HIM. Two can play this game!Christ on a Bike, there were four more men tailing me and the tail, following me good friends! I didn’t know if Larry and Kenny had seen these four, but noted they had turned towards the expansive Central Park, where slushy paths between piled snow provided a fair cover - not to mention it wasn’t the nicest weather for a stroll in the park.When my friends paused, all five of these goons yelled and charged them! Two pulled pistols from their jackets, the others had clubs and knives and saps. A furious and quick exchange saw “Skinny” Larry yank the gun away from one of them, and throw it into the Hudson! A single shot agitated the pigeons, who flapped and fluttered into the air. Kenny Filmore had wounded one of the attackers! Using my subterfuge to my advantage, I charged up from behind and nearly cut one of the guy’s legs off with my Fireman’s axe, a crimson spray decorating the snow. Then Larry winged one in the arm, and I added to his misery by striking him on the bridge of the nose with my axe handle. He collapsed, moaning.The other’s bravado had flagged, and they decided running like hell was their best course of action.I slapped some snow on the broken nose guy, but Kenny brushed me away, tending to the crushed cartilage in a more professional manner. I carried him to get a taxi while Larry and Kenny briefly searched through the others’ possessions. They had little, except a box of smokes, matches, and a straight razor.We piled into a taxi, and Kenny slapped a bill on the dash to “forget about us”. The cabbie said “Kinda early to tie one on, friends”, and drove us to a quiet location ‘way on the other side of the park, where we found seclusion behind some bushes next to a frozen man-made lake. Our friend wouldn’t give up the goods, and ended up planting Kenny’s “persuasive” knife through his eyelid and into his brain, expiring silently.The would-be assassin had a blackjack (Ace and Ten of Spades) tattoo on his bicep. Just a thug. But wait! He also had one of them “Pangas” under his trousers, secured to his hip and thigh.We covered him with some snow and walked away, trying to figure out who wanted us dead. The crooked Police Chief? The shriveled guy with the basement of horrors? Someone we crossed without us knowing, by talking to Martin’s friends and visiting Sing Sing? The guy that got away, down the fire escape, after carving up Jackson Elias?I had left the bloody shabby plaid coat rolled up with the dead cultist.I was hungry again, so we got more sandwiches and checked out three used bookstores. In the third, I found a tome on Egyptian Death Cults, which had slipped partially behind the row of books on its shelf. It described a cult that had relocated from Egypt to Kenya (Again, with the Kenya connection - Mombassa, Nairobi, etc). I bought the book.I really need to get a map of Kenya. Mark that. I’m so forgetful sometimes.Must be the head trauma from the war and the boxing ring.Now, back at our hotel, it seems our friends, Stig and Aaron. had fought off some intruders. There’s a benefit to keeping a loaded pistol at the ready. The staff were so accommodating and apologetic, we moved rooms - and promptly booked the week in advance, then snuck out. We checked into a different hotel about three-quarters of a mile away.My friends are REALLY smart.Wednesday January 21, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsAfter waking and getting cleaned up, we visited the Carlyle Estate. Bradley Grey is Erica Carlyle’s lawyer, and apparently also her social secretary in some sense. She agreed to talk to us on the condition that we don’t mention her family without her approval. I think she’s afraid we’re going to finish Jackson’s book, when all we really want is to break his murderers to justice.We learned there’s some sort of secret related to a Negro woman named Bunet (did I spell that right?). Bunet was a priestess, according to Roger. Oh, and Roger has a collection of weird books kept in a lock box in the family library. Erica invited us to her upcoming Eclipse Party at the Carlyle Estate, and then gave us access to the library for the afternoon. She went through an elaborate ritual to open the secret shelves where Roger’s special books are hidden. There are four of them.That’s where we left off for this episodeGentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsOff to the Carlysle Estate in Filmore’s fancy schmancy car! It must’ve cost a mint! We came clean to Erica, and offered her the right of first refusal to any story we’d publish of our exploits and discoveries. She wanted to put this business behind her, and protect what remained of her family name. I told her we had two different accounts of her brother’s demise - “mutilated bodies found” vs “only the black porter’s bodies were found, no whites”.Elias had also reached out to her but she had demurred. Roger’s expedition was a foolish whim, but there was some secret he had possessed and did not tell her. Pointing to a photo, she described a Negress with a French name - “Boonen” or something. She fit into this somehow.Roger (I think) had had some strange dreams, and reached out to Dr Robert Huskem (Huston?) regarding this woman. Was she a Princess? Queen? Priestess? She spoke with a distinctive accent of the African Continent and had an air of … royalty … about her.This willing exchange with Erica continued - she permitted us to sit down in her library and read passages from some of her rare books (kept in a secure safe behind a secret wall). She revealed the combination was scribed into a different mundane book out in the unsecured bookshelves. This library was decorated with the symbology of the Sun and Moon. Sun and Moon - THE UPCOMING ECLIPSE !! Erica invited us to a party (optional mask, but fine dress) celebrating this event. A great lead - the perfect site for the next sacrificial murder (I suspect the catering crew will be part of this!)This library was NICE - she placed a couple of books onto a table. A rare Pinochet manuscript, a book called “Life as a God”, another titled “Amongst the Stones”, and one or two others. Good thing my friends are smarter than me and fast readers!" }, { "title": "Episode 10 - Under the Floorboards - October 6, 2024", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-10/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-10-06 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper Bringer of torment and delights Todd Lawrence “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor, saxophonist, and engineer Eric Father Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Catholic priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Eli Dr. Kenneth Filmore Wealthy medical doctor and neurosurgeon Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter “Stig” von Stiglitz Former German POW JournalMonday January 19, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsThe MorningWe have finally accepted that our old friend Oxford “Ox” Sykes will not be joining us on our current explorations. However, I learned that Dr. Filmore, the surgeon assigned to the Lyon Field Hospital that I met during the war, was also a friend of Jackson Elias. He arrived in Manhattan today, and we were reacquainted at the Ramsey Law Office. More on that in a bit.After breakfast, we pursued two parallel lines of investigation.Jerry went to the New York Public Library in search of any references to the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. But he found none.Meanwhile, Aaron and I went to the Juju House to scope it out. It’s at 132nd and Ransom Court. Inside was an old man in a red blanket, who we assumed must be Silas N’Kwame, the Mombasan owner we had heard about. He seemed forthcoming enough with information, and we learned that Dr. Mordecai Lemming is a regular buyer of his merchandise. Lemming lives at the Murray Hill Hotel, and is a crackpot. Ahja Singh is his supplier. Some of Juju’s products are local, some imported. The store is open from 9am to 5pm each day except Sunday, and closed from noon to 1pm for lunch. We got the impression that Mr. N’Kwame’s home is adjacent to his shop, through the door we noticed behind the counter.Unexpected ReunionAfter a lunch of pastrami sandwiches, we met at the Ramsey Law Office, and that’s when we met up with Dr. Filmore for the first time in several years. Mr. Ramsey shared a nice bottle of bourbon, to accompany the reading of the will. But rather than reading the will itself, Mr. Ramsey instead read a letter that Elias had written for us, before his death. He sensed he was in great danger, and updated his affairs with his lawyer only a day before he was killed.The Final Letter from Jackson Elias Greetings from beyond the grave! By now you know that all I’ve really left you is a whole heap of trouble. If I were still around to have an opinion on the matter, I would understand if you decided to walk away from it all. Hell, if I’m dead right now, that’s a good indication I should have done the same. But you know me too well, and I know you too well. If you were the kind of person who always did the sensible thing we wouldn’t be such good friends. You have been there when I needed you in the past and I hope you will be again, even if it’s too late to save me. I’ve been pulling threads all over the world, and while most of them are still unravelling I think I’m onto something big. Carlton and Jonah can fill in more of the details for you - I’ve left some of my papers and notes with them, which should help you work out which hornets nests you need to poke next. I trust you to bring my killers to justice. Of course, I’m assuming I was murdered - it will be just plain embarrassing if was run over by a trolley car! Follow my investigation to its bloody end, and seek out the truth. I’m not asking you to finish my book — none of you can write worth a damn. Your friend always, JacksonFinal Letter from Jackson EliasThe Rest of the DetailsRamsey is now in charge of what remains in Elias’ bank account. Jackson appointed him as a trustee for it, and wants the money to be used by us to continue his investigations. We decided to name this venture The Good Friends of Jackson Elias, Inc..At this point, we have the following obvious areas of investigation ahead of us: Miss Carlyle in NYC Break into Juju House to look at the business’ books (and maybe discover who their biggest customers are) Visit the Harvard Library to find out more about the missing book Prepare for the upcoming eclipse, and another possible murderThat NightOnce things wrapped up at the law office, we went to the Juju House to stake it out. We saw Silas leaving the place, and sent Stig to follow Silas, with instructions to make sure he doesn’t come back in under an hour.Before breaking into the Juju House, we noticed a locked door in the alley that Aaron was able to pick. We snuck inside and found that it’s the abandoned storefront of a former pawn shop - two rooms with some basic cabinets, desks, etc. There’s nothing of interest here, but it could be a handy place for us to stake out Juju House.Then we proceeded to the Juju House. Aaron’s lockpicking skills were not on display, and he had to break the lock to get in. Father Jerry stayed outside as a guard, while Aaron, Dr. Filmore (Kenny), and I went into the store. I took the business ledger and stuffed it in my satchel, to be analyzed later. Aaron spotted a fancy Bloody Tongue headpiece, and took that. When he realized the red ribbon had been replaced by a real human tongue, I think he turned even whiter than normal. Kenny found a trap door under the rug, which revealed stone stairs leading 20 feet down.There were strange runes and symbols carved onto the walls. Kenny took some etchings, while I took a photo or two. That led to a locked reinforced door with straps and bars and some different carvings. Again, Kenny took etchings and I took a photo. Nobody could get the lock open, so we took the pins out of the hingest, allowing us to open the door from the other side.This led to a large room with a 15’ high ceiling. It was made of very nice dressed stone, and reminded me of a courthouse or Freemason lodge. There were torches on the walls, and a circular stone block on the floor with a cranked chain to lift it. I played the “Skinny Larry” card, and got Kenny and Aaron to lift the block up. It revealed an 8’ diameter pit.Inside the pit was something unnatural. I didn’t see it, but I heard it. The shrieking was worse than a dozen French soldiers walking into a surprise cloud of mustard gas. Aaron viewed it from above. He later described it a “large, amorphous blob, covered in human faces.” Frankly, I think this… creature, or whatever you want to call it… had an impact on his famously unflappable “there’s a scientific explanation for everything” attitude. He got a couple of photos. I could barely stand the horrible screams from the thing, so we headed out just as quick as we could.But on the way out, Aaron stirred up four things. People? Creatures? They moved, looked, and smelled like the animated dead. Each of the four had scars on their heads in the same pattern as those that the assassins carved into Jackson’s head on his death bed. I made a quick photograph of them as well. I hope these photographs come out well.We rushed back up the stairs, and realized that there is really no way to hide the break-in. We couldn’t put the stone lid back on the pit without confronting the undead guardians and the horrible noise. And we didn’t stop to put the door back on its hinges. So, since it’s going to be obvious someone broke in to the Juju House, I decided to try to mislead whoever visits next. I wrote a short note and left it on the counter. It says, “The deal is off. Robson.”The Deal is OffGentleman Jerry’s Conjectures and MusingsToday is the day of the reading of Jackson’s will. The Eclipse is a week away, Monday the 24th. Ach! What a great day that would be for a sacrifice. We need to find a place that evening to lie in wait.Oh, I returned my two library books. We have a slip of paper describing a book that Jackson wanted, that was missing from the Miskatonic College (?) Library. No details regarding its name, author, nor date of publication.Some of the others went to the Ju-Ju place, in the mouth of an alleyway, W 137th street. Lots of tenements and a small square. The shop had some pieces of art, masks, and fetishes in the window. They tell me they were served by a short, dark, shriveled old man wrapped in a red blanket. The shop dealt with the sale of “Imports and Art”.The man described the crazy guy we already knew about, don’t scold me for the spelling. “Murderkeing Lemming”. Maybe some tie to E 40th and Park Ave, the Murray Hill Hotel. This crazy guy was interested in fetishes, anthropology, and religions (of the African Continent, I’d guess).I think they said the shriveled guy’s name is Silas Kwami. Larry showed me the stuffed snake he bought. I think it’s pretty nice. The shop is open from 9-5 with a break from 12-1, closed Sunday. I wonder if Silas is a church-going man? Oh, we found out he lives in a room in the back of the shop.Over at Ramsey and his Secretary’s, 124th and Lennox, we all showed up for the reading of the will. Elias had left us a note. He wanted us to investigate and retrace the steps of the doomed Carlysle expedition, and we’d be provided “all paid expenses” - within reason.Here are the names of the explorers: Carlysle Anhew (Bert or Brnt - what did I write here?) Huskam (Psych) Hypatia Master (Archivist) Jack Brady (Friend)We went and waited for Silas to go out that night, and sure enough he did; Stig told us he went out for dinner. Across the alley was a padlocked door that led to a vacant Pawn Shop. I wandered down to the local church while the rest explored it, to pay my respects to the local Padre. I dropped some coins in the poor box and returned to the alley and waited outside in case Silas or that shaved headed guy showed up while my friends were inside the Ju-Ju House. They showed me a headband they found with a human tongue instead of the cloth ribbon. They grabbed his ledger, too. They pulled back the rug and found a trap door, went down stone stairs and popped the hinges on a stout door. It has weird symbols on it which they made a “rub” of and photographed.They winched up a stone plug, revealing an oily black fleshy thing with shrieking human faces, and were approached by four zombies, disemboweled with that carving thing on their foreheads. They snapped some photos and skedaddled.I bet the folks that had disappeared over the years were made into zombies or absorbed by the hideous fleshy thing." }, { "title": "Episode 9 - The Train to Sing Sing - September 22, 2024", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-9/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-09-22 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper   Todd Lawrence Simons Inventor and jazz musician Eric Father Gerald O’Shea Priest, former bare-knuckles boxer Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz Former German POW Tom Oxford “Ox” Sykes Chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well JournalSaturday January 17, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsThe funeral of Jackson Elias was today. It wasn’t well attended - just us, Jackson’s lawyer Carleton Ramsey, Ramsey’s niece, and publisher Jonah Kensington. There were some reporters who stayed a respectable distance away. Jackson had no family, so had no family at the funeral. The attorney told us that the reading of the will is scheduled for Monday the 19th at Ramsey’s law office.Next we went to the Lafayette theater in Harlem to talk to Millie Adams and Rebecca Shosenberg. Millie does some work at the theater. She told us that Teddy’s Saloon is where a neighborhood watch group met that included her husband Hilton Adams. This group were all former members of the Harlem Hellfighters.Millie imparted a few useful clues to us in our conversation. When bodies started appearing in Harlem, the police blamed it on drugs, on an African Death Cult, etc. Dr. Lemming ??? They found a cult in Harlem with some connection to East Africa Ju Ju House Hilton was arrested over a body. The cops said he used his Army knife, but Millie said he never took it out of the house. The four men of the neighborhood watch are: Needham Jonson Douglas Fells Art Mills Jackie Wallace Before we parted ways, Mrs. Adams gave us her telephone number.Our next stop was Teddy’s Saloon, but the dorman wouldn’t let us in. So we went across the street and did some gambling and relaxing. After a while, Needham and Art arrived. They confirmed msot of what we think. The neighborhood watch stopped after Hilton was arrested.Could the police or some other group be doing some crime each new moon and committing the murders themselves to drive people off the streets so there are no witnesses?Art is a trumpeter, and led us across the street to Teddy’s. We played some music, and now are welcome there in the future.From the journal of Gentleman JerryJackson Elias’ funeral at Cyprus Hills Cemetery, 2PMAt the funeral we met Jonah Kensington (the publisher) and Carlton Ramsey (the lawyer), with his niece Willa. Not many people were in attendance. I spoke a few words about our friend. Ramsey wouldn’t divulge the contents of the will but hinted we were in it. Huh. Jackson didn’t have any family, it seemed.The publisher, Jonah, gave us a bunch of Jackson’s papers, some partially finished chapters of a book and research notes. Skinny Larry sure is proud of that oiled leather attache of his.Mille Adams at the Lafayette Theater, 5PMAt the Theater, Rebecca Shosenburg showed up, as she was friendly with Millie Adams. I made sure no one shot her with a “prop” pistol, because stuff like that always happens wherever we go. Seems Hilton, her husband, was part of a gang of ex-military, who patrolled the neighborhood and called themselves the “Harlem Hellfighters”, a nod to their division in the war. Tough guys with a reputation for taking on dirty jobs for long weeks (holding an area). They hung at Teddy’s Saloon, and were four in number: Needham Johnson Douglass Fells Art Mills Jackie WallsMillie also spilled the beans about a “Crackpot” named Dr Lemming who believed that an “East African Death Cult” was responsible for the eight, now nine, slayings. I really need to get me a map of Africa! The headband with the ribbon was one of their signs - Mille said Hilton kept one as a bookmark in his book which Robbson kept as evidence. I’d really like to get a peek at that book! Somehow this all ties back to the Ju-Ju house, which isn’t a tea shop or such - it’s a place to buy African knick-knacks and carvings and such. We got Millie’s telephone number.We tried to get into Teddy’s Saloon but the bouncer would have none of it. We told him if one of Hilton’s four friends happened by, we would be drinking a Root Beer across the street. Johnson and Mills came to find us and while they were initially wary, our fellow veteran status broke the ice and they invited us back to Teddy’s and vouched for us. There we met the other two. Skinny Larry performed in an impromptu Jazz Trio, the guy’s got talent!Sunday January 18, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsThe morning started with a train ride to Sing Sing Prison. Mrs. Adams had written a letter to Mr. Adams for us to take to him. I read the letter on the train and found an encoded message where she “signed” the message to indicate that it was authentic (I assume).When we arrived, we met with Mr. Bronton, the warden. He said we can’t hand Hilton the letter directly, but we can let him read it or we can read it to him. And then we can hand it to the warden and he’ll gives it to Hilton later.Our impression was that Hilton looks alright. He doesn’t seem mistreated.According to Hilton Adams… He came across the body, but the cops were already waiting for him in hiding when he arrived. Then they pounced on him. This seems to indicate that Hilton was framed. But of course it’s his word against the police. He had found mention of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue with some connection to Juju House. There was a muscular shaven-headed African guy, M’Kunga Mukugna (or something like that).Speculation: Maybe the cops are being paid by Juju House.Speculation: The red ribbon on the goons who killed Jackson Elias could be the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.After returning to New York City, we briefly looked at the crime scene to see if we could find a curved knife that had been overlooked or discarded somewhere. But no luck.Next up: visit Juju House the reading of the willFrom the journal of Gentleman JerryAfter a long trip up the river (heh) to Sing Sing, we met George Branton who gave us 30 minutes with Hilton. We presented Millie’s Letter for inspection. Millie had scratched the six letters spelling out her name - smart dame! Now, we told Hilton we would try to free him, as he was on borrowed time. The police appeared on the scene VERY quickly and the Bowie Knife was taken from his home - he did not carry it on patrol. He mentioned the “Cult of the Bloody Tongue” - that’s the red ribbon! And hinted there were disappearances before 1919.Hilton Adams warned us about a muscular man with a shaved head, Mukunga Midori, who Hilton had followed to a coffee house on 139th Ave.Oh, I looked for a machete in the alley where HIlton was arrested - no dice.Jackson’s NotesHere are the various notes and photographs belonging to Jackson Elias.

He has a feisty, friendly air about him. As an orphan in Stratford, Connecticut, he learned to make his own way early in life. He has no living relatives, and no permanent address.You like him, and value his friendship, even though months and sometimes years separate one meeting from the next. You’d be upset and probably crave vengeance if anything happened to your friend. The world is a better place for having Jackson Elias in it.Elias speaks several languages fluently and is constantly traveling. He is social, enjoys an occasional drink, and smokes a pipe. A tough, stable, and punctual man, Elias is unafraid of brawls or officials.He is mostly self-educated. Once a skeptic, Elias began to question his stance after the events he witnessed in the mountains of Peru, although in most cases he has failed to find proof of supernatural powers, magic, or dark gods. His well-researched works always seem to reflect first-hand experience. Possibly his greatest flaw is that he’s secretive, and never discusses a project until he has a final draft in hand.His writings characterize and analyze death cults. His best-known book is Sons of Death, exposing modern-day Thuggee cults in India. All of his books illustrate how cults manipulate the fears of their followers. Insanity and feelings of inadequacy characterize death cultists; feelings for which they compensate by slaughtering innocents to make themselves feel powerful or chosen. Cults draw the weak-minded, though cult leaders are usually clever and manipulative. When fear of a cult stops, the cult vanishes.Elias’ published works include: Skulls Along the River (1910)-exposes headhunter cults in the Amazon basin. Masters of the Black Arts (1912)-surveys supposed sorcerous cults throughout history. The Way of Terror (1913)- analyzes systematization of fear through cult organization; warmly reviewed by George Sorel. The Smoking Heart (1915)-first half discusses historical Mayan death cults, the second half concerns present-day Central American death cults. Sons of Death (1918)-modern-day Thuggees; Elias infiltrated the cult and wrote a book about it. Witch Cults of England (1920)-summarizes covens in nine English counties; interviews practicing English witches; Rebecca West thought some of the material trivial and overworked. The Black Power (1921)-expands upon The Way of Terror and includes some material on Asian and African death cults; includes interviews with several anonymous cult leaders. The Hungry Dead (1923)-exposes the modern-day survival of a Peruvian and Bolivian death cult from the time of the conquistadors. It omits many of the weirder details that those who accompanied Elias on his researches may remember, presenting the cult of the kharisiri as a purely human evil.All of these books are published by Prospero House of New York City, and were edited by owner/editor Jonah Kensington. Kensington is a good friend of Jackson Elias and someone you may have previously met.News StoriesHere is some old news, backstory, and clues relevant to the next adventure.Old Message from Jackson Elias HAVE INFORMATION CONCERNING CARLYLE EXPEDITION STOPNEED RELIABLE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM STOPMEET JANUARY 15 NEW YORK STOPJACKSON ELIASTelegramFrom the New York Pillar/Riposte, April 4th, 1919BIG APPLE DATELINEROGER CARLYLE the playboy whom everybody knows - or knows about - is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt!

She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition.Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activites with Colony representives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow.Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyle’s purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage.New York Pillar articleFrom the New York Pillar/Riposte, May 24th, 1920CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMEDNAIROBI (Reuters)– The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle Expedition was confirmed today by district police representitives.Roger Carlyle, New York’s rollicking playboy, is counted among the dead.Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains fo at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in a remote region of the Aberdare Forest.Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyle’s sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, although police actually found the site.Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead.New York Pillar articleFrom the New York Pillar/Riposte, June 19th, 1920MURDERERS HANGEDNAIROBI (Reuters)–Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial.To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal why they had slaughtered Mr. Carlyle and his companions. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were subject to the most savage treatment, preventing all but the most preliminary identification of the remains.Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice.New York Pillar articleJournalsThursday January 15, 1925From the journal of Lawrence SimonsIt’s been years since any of us saw Jackson Elias in person, but he has summoned us to a meeting in New York City. On a snowy winter day, we arrived at room 410, rapped on the door, and got no response. A hotel maid let us in, which is where we witnessed three goons standing over Jackson’s corpse. The killed him with a knife, and we got let ‘em have it.When all was said and done, we had one live and one dead goon to hand over to the police. Lt. Martin Pool was the beat cop we met. He said this was the 9th such murder, and we got handed off to Pool’s superior, Captain Robson, a man who looks too well dressed to be a civil servant.Our friend Jackson’s funeral was scheduled for January 17 at Cypress Hills. Having already booked rooms for a stay in NYC, we returned there to regroup, before setting out in search of clues. Some shorthand notes: we have an appointment for the 18th at Sing Sing prison to meet Hilton Adams Adams was arrested and convicted for the last murder, but we think he was framed so does Rebecca Shosenberg, reporter with the New York Times the dates of the previous string of murders were one lunar month apart, but this latest one - Jackson’s - doesn’t fit we talked to Captain Robson, and started to get the impression he’s not New York’s finestI took an immediate liking to Miss Shosenberg, and asked her to join me for a night on the town. We went to a club later that evening. But first there was more clue gathering: Emerson Imports agent for Mombasan exporter Ahja Singh Ju Ju House at 1 Ransom Court is run by Silas N’Kwame, an elderly MombasanFrom the journal of Gentleman JerryFive years have elapsed since our excursion to Peru. Jackson ELias reached out to me via telegram to meet him at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 401. The group got together and headed over. No one answered as we knocked, so we suppressed the urge to break down the door, and instead asked the maid, a dozen rooms down, to check in on our friend.We happened upon three men standing over the bloody body of our friend, lying on the bed. Each man wore a leather headband from which hung a piece of red ribbon or cloth. One cleared the open window, to the fourth floor fire escape and started descending. The second felt the fury of my uppercut, while the third crumpled, shot by one of our pistols - I don’t know whose. The maid ran screaming down the hallway, I was hoping she had the sense to call the police..A second murderer leapt through the window, leaving a crimson trail. I jumped through the window but didn’t quite clear its width, and stumbled out onto the icy latticework. I heard another shot behind me - my friends sure are trigger-happy.The first fellow was down at about the second floor, preparing to slide down the ladder. I saw a black Hudson Roadster waiting in the snowy alley - the getaway vehicle ! I judged that I could catch the straggler, so I dashed down a few steps and launched myself at his fleeing form.Luck was on my side, or maybe it was my Guardian Angel, as I landed heavily on the man and pinned him down, then proceeded to ram his head against the steel platform. I took a shot at the car’s tire with my service revolver, but doubt I even hit the vehicle, at the odd angle and such.I was surprised that the car sped down the length of the alley, and ended up sliding and skidding and up on its side. The guy running for it just passed it by and made good his escape. I heard sirens nearby - sometimes the cops are on top of things.I trussed up my unconscious buddy and hauled him back to room 401. My pals had already collected Jackson’s stuff. Including a Shanghai Matchbook, Photo of a Chinese Junk, Letter from a Harvard Professor, a Business card from Penhew something or other, a card from Emmerson Imports something or other, and a sort of playbook describing a two hour lecture that had already happened. What a bunch of unrelated clues.Lt Martin Poole told us this was the ninth such murder, my friends telling me of an odd carving in our poor friend’s forehead, like two quarter moons facing each other with some dots in between. Gruesome stuff.Stig called Miskatonic University and tried unsuccessfully to contact the speaker, an Anthony Cowles, I think he was a guest from Sydney or something. I think that’s in Australia. Anyway, he couldn’t get through to him.Lt Poole told us about a man captured in an alleyway in Harlem holding a bloody Bowie knife over murder victim number eight, one Hilton Adams - currently in Sing Sing awaiting an up close ‘n personal meeting with ‘Ol Sparky. A Bowie Knife? The guys that offed our pal Jackson carried out the brutality with these machetes called “Pangas”.Poole referred us to the Harlem Precinct, where we met Captain Robbson. One of my buds thought he was dressed a little sharp for a Captain - I don’t know. Fashion ain’t my thing. Was he on the take?Robbson verified something I already knew, since I had gone to the library and talked a helpful librarian into helping me collect the other eight newspapers with the other deaths reported. Didn’t hurt that she was a fetching lass - oh, my oaths! Anyway, seven of the eight were clustered in one part of Harlem, one was a bit outside but still in Harlem, and Jackson died well outside of the borough. What else? The black Hudson had been stolen, the driver and the guy I had landed on top of were in custody, and no, we couldn’t have one of the headband things.The smarter among us told me that Robbson just wanted this whole Hilton Adams thing to be buttoned up neatly.Of course we bought the day’s paper with the article of Jackson’s death. We decided to hunt down his agent, Jonah Kensngton, in New York City, at the “Prospero House”. Oh, Jackson Elias would be buried on Sunday, January the 18th, 2PM. Not really though, ‘cause the ground was frozen. Back to the article - it was penned by Rebecca Shosenburg. We stopped in at the Newspaper’s main office, her desk was remarkably neat and orderly. She opened up when we told her we thought Hilton Adams was “set up”. All eight murders had occurred during a New Moon, over about a two year period. Adams was in prison for over a year, now.Oh, there was a Total Eclipse coming up on the 25th, in about a week.Now we found out that Jackson Elias’ lawyer was named Carlton Ramsey, and there would be a reading of the will after the funeral. We were in it.I had thumbed through the two books on African folklore I had checked out from the library, it only hinted at an African Cult in Nairobi.The Newspaper gal (Rebecca) said she would set up a meeting with Millie Adams, Hilton’s wife. Maybe she could fill in some piece of this puzzle. To further cement our fledgling relationship, we promised her the right of first refusal on anything we discovered that was article-worthy and needed a byline.The one card from Emerson Imports Facility pointed to Arthur Emerson, with connections to Mombasa (I really need a map of Africa). I took a smoke on the corner while the prettier among us talked to this import guy. I heard second-hand that Silas Kwamay runs a place called Ju-Ju House at 1 Ransom Ct New York City and … um … dealt with an Exporter named Aja Singh, Was Aja Singh Arthur Emerson’s contact? Don’t know.We were to meet Millie at the Black Playhouse, the Lafayette Theatre.A letter from Elias had hinted one of the Carlysle Party (in Africa, of course) had survived, after all. We had read somewhere that everyone had been hacked up real good, whites and blacks.Skinny Larry had taken a shine to Rebecca, the Newspaper gal, so when he met her for dinner, I bought Stig a steak dinner at an inconspicuous corner table, just in case anyone started any trouble. Because we attract that sorta thing.Friday January 16, 1925Jackson Elias’ DeathFrom the journal of Lawrence SimonsWe made arrangements to meet Millie Adams, the wife of Hilton Adams, at the Lafayette Theater tomorrow.We also visited Jackson Elias’ publisher, and got all his notes.Also learned Carleton Ramsey is Elias’ lawyer. There’s some talk about Elias having a will, and maybe we’re in it." }, { "title": "Episode 7 - Unusual Treehuggers, Part 2 - August 28, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-7/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-08-28 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper   Todd “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor and jazz musician Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Eric Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Former bare-knuckles boxer Tom Oxford “Ox” Sykes Chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz former German POW JournalThe explorers hitched Apple up to the buggy, and returned it … and the teenagers … to the town of Foxfield. The Town Council meeting convened at 7:00, the church (which served as the council hall) was filled to capacity, and even a little bit more.Barnes led the session from a wooden lectern. The three council members sat impassively at a long wooden table. Two major factions of townspeople - those for logging the northern forest and those against - sat on separate sides of the aisle. At the behest of the louder, pro-lumber half of the crowd, a vote on the Cressfield Lumber matter was called.Constable Richard Slate once again voted against the measure.Shirley Suttler, a 30-year-old with a pleasant disposition, changed her vote to “Yes”.Before Zeke Copely could vote … with certainty, a “Yes”, which would have passed the matter … Barnes banged his gavel for the two day period of “cooling off” before proceeding. Copley’s brother, Ike, whooped and catcalled from the audience. The once-shepherds-turned-farmers amidst the rocky terrain north of the town were growing closer to an economic boom from the harvesting of timber.Oxford seemed unusually put-out when the council made it clear that his offer on the mill would not be debated until after the vote, and threatened (to no avail) to reduce his generous bid on the old building.“Gentleman” Jerry escorted Agnes back to the rooming house, and the group decided to take the stolen newspapers with them, lest they be found sitting in their rooms, evidence of their break-in.They discussed waiting a day or two to try to confront Barnes at the waterfall cave, but Jerry would have none of that. He raised his hand. “Och, I’m goin’ to the cave to wait for our friend - tonight” - “Gentleman” JerryThe rest agreed, and they made their way to the lush growth of the waterfall by lantern and headlamp, and lay in wait for the Councilman. They didn’t have long to wait, their lights shuttered, as they saw a lantern approaching, borne, as expected, by Barnes, who notably also bore a five-sided rod made of stone.The party followed him into the cave, through the waterfall, using the water’s noise to cover their footfalls. They tackled Barnes, as Aaron took a lightning bolt to the chest. Pointing lights up, they espied an odd human-sized lobster-insect-bat-fungus being hovering above, variegated colors shimmering. It bore a stiff length of wire, attached to several evenly spaced crystals. Jerry stood over the supine Barnes, grasping his axe, the stone “key” stuck through his suspender straps.Skinny Larry aimed his revolver for a shot, but his gun jammed. Ox flung his heavy red jacket at the creature, hoping to catch it in a makeshift net, but missed badly and slipped on the wet stone floor to boot. Aaron fired a shot into it, then applied a healing salve to his scorched flesh. The bullet had pierced directly through the creature, with little to no effect. It trilled, and shot through the waterfall to the outside of the alcove. Larry followed it, gun readied, and spotted the creature flitting amongst the trees, preparing to re-engage.As it flew back into the round cave, Jerry swung his axe but missed. Ox, realizing he had a proper mosquito net in his jungle expedition kit, dug it out of his pack. Stretching the net across the cave mouth, Aaron and Ox managed to entangle the creature. Pinning it, the group demanded an explanation from Barnes, but all he could do was gibber nonsense. So they unceremoniously killed the creature, opened the door with a twist, and crawled through a short, pentagonal-shaped tunnel. The creature was like nothing any had seen before, except Barnes, who apparently had some sort of ongoing relationship with its kin. Was it an extraterrestrial alien? An exotic creature from lands unknown? A faerie? “Strangest ugly little faerie I could imagine” - “Gentleman” JerryOpening a door at the far end, the explorers entered a large cavern. In its center was a five-level step pyramid, at its apex, two tusk-like protrusions mounted and pointed at each other, somewhat offset in height. Six of the aliens flitted about, tending to large metal machines with blinking lights. One was larger than the rest.Barnes rushed forward and collapsed, crying upon one of a pair of large square boxes. On the other side stood five large test tubes, slightly aglow, full of some foul liquid.One of the creatures flew between the horns, folded into two dimensions, and vanished. A portal! The combatants surmised it would return shortly with greater numbers.The men sprung into action. Ox and Jerry leapt up the inverted ziggurat, dodging insectoid attacks, where Jerry struck one of the spikes with his axe. Ox wrapped his trusty net around the span - hoping to prevent the creatures from escaping and/or returning with reinforcements.Aaron drew his machete and went toe-to-to with the large leader. “Mi-gos”, he mused, drawing upon the myths and tales he had read some time ago. The rest of the group had no idea what he meant. “Well ok then, you goes!” Ox shouted in confusion.Larry began studying the array of buttons and levels. After a fruitless attempt to comprehend the device, he fired his revolver into it, causing it to spark and whir.Once the creatures were dealt with (two escaped back down the corridor and out into the world), mostly due to Ox’s and Aaron’s brutal weapon attacks, the two boxes were opened, revealing the sub-zero interiors where Barne’s two children lay, dead, their brains missing. After sundering one of the horns, Jerry bashed the test tubes, each containing a growing sickening mockery of the human form.Larry urged the group to grab Barnes and the kids and leave, as a self-destruct sequence seemed to have been initiated. With haste they left, and once outside, the ground shook from a tremendous subterranean explosion.They decided to return Barnes and his children’s bodies to town, without fanfare, and left for Boston, as suddenly as they had arrived, leaving the beleaguered townsfolk to draw their own conclusions.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALLtTfjw1jOGF3tCTMWNwvpqrENllACQhRl3A8fHqkM/edit#heading=h.cn6weixvo86q" }, { "title": "Episode 6 - Unusual Treehuggers, Part 1 - August 14, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-6/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-08-14 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper   Todd “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor and jazz musician Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Eric Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Former bare-knuckles boxer Tom Oxford “Ox” Sykes Chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz former German POW JournalWith the Peruvian pyramid mission wrapped up, the party shortly left Lima for America by steamship. Before leaving, though, Jerry picked up a New York Times (English) with an article about Antarctic explorers that uncovered evidence of a subterranean complex, miles deep.Back in the USA, the explorers enjoyed their “down time” in their own ways. By autumn, they each received a signed copy of Jesse/Jackson’s (aka Jackson Elias’s) latest book, which listed each of them as contributors and dedicated the book to them.Skinny Larry rented a small commercial space in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia, and outfitted it as a laboratory, with cylinders, beakers, tubing, Bunsen burners, and other equipment suitable for an inventor.An old war buddy of the group, David Sutton, approached them with a newspaper article chronicling a death threat against his cousin in Foxfield, Massachusetts, Henry Barnes. Sutton was associated with the owner of the residence they had purged, Arnold Knott. He asked the group if they could visit Foxfield and check in on his cousin, as he was busy with business in town that he couldn’t drop.On a brisk October Tuesday, the group rented a car and set off for the small town. Barnes was purportedly the Town Supervisor and a pastor at the local Foxfield Unitarian Church, which was built in the Gothic Revival style.The group passed through picturesque farmland and entered the town proper. They immediately acquired lodging with a woman named Agnes, who had rooms to let. They had passed the church, with its Gothic architecture, wrought-iron decoration and flying buttresses.An example of a Gothic Revival Church, but not a picture of the one in FoxfieldThe group learned that a lumber company, Cressfield Lumber, was trying to lease logging rights to the woodlands north of town. Agnes also related the name of Barnes’ assailant, “Ike Copely”, a former preacher of a competing “Congregates” church, that followed the “old ways” of Christianity. That sounded like Fundamentalism to the party, though none are experts in religion.Searching for a good way to get started, as a stop-in to talk to Barnes’ proved fruitless, they visited the burned-out husk of the Old Mill, formerly a wool and cloth facility owned and operated by the Pickering family. Naturally, the group ignored the “No Trespassing” sign and approached the ruins, looking over the dam, and its old water wheel half-submerged in the river that ran alongside. They befriended a Polish teen-ager, Peter Choplinski, who told them it burned about ten years ago. Jerry slipped him a buck, and he showed them a concealed entrance to the structure.They discussed the possibility that the Pickering family had set fire to the mill (arson), for the insurance money. Jerry struck a roadside flare for light.Peter helpfully pointed out spots in the floor to avoid, and they crept down stone stairs to the basement, which housed rusted, twisted, burned machinery. A giant tick, over eight inches across, jumped onto Jerry’s leg and bit him, painfully injecting its venom. Jerry tried to stab the “scuttler” with the business end of the flare as Aaron tried to flip it aside with a machete.They got it off and tended to the injury. Skinny Larry put the tick in a large ink jar, hoping to analyze it later, but also expecting it to rapidly decompose in sunlight, as Peter suggested.Finding only soggy, ruined records upstairs, they surmised the Old Mill was unrelated to the Barnes issue. So they visited the Feed and Livery store and met Richard Slate, who worked there, and was the town constable as well. Jerry purchased some twine, a length of chain and a padlock, and some empty burlap sacks. (“You can’t have too many of these.”)Slate offered other information, such as the fact that Barnes lived at the old Pickering Estate. Businesses started closing after the mill fire. A newspaper, the Foxfield Courier, owned by a man named Willson, also had shuttered its doors.They visited Parker’s General Store, and met Louise Madsen. She explained the members of the town council were,Shirley SutlerZeke Copely (his brother, Ike was the assailant who attacked Barnes)Richard Slate (also serves as Constable)Louise serves as Town Clerk and there was to be a council meeting at 7:00 PM the following evening. She also holds the keys to the newspaper building, empty but for old issues and a large printing press.While the party accompanied Louise to the Courier building, Jerry stayed behind to talk to the odd man sweeping the store, Rodney. He had little to tell, and had lost his senses in the war, which disfigured his skull.Under the guise that Oxford’s family wishes to buy the printing press, they surveyed the establishment.Later that evening, after a nice steak and potato dinner provided by Agnes, the group crept out and broke into the Courier building and appropriated about two months of issues after May 15th, 1911, the date the mill burned. They provided absolutely no information. They propped the door shut with a shim and encountered Slate roving the town as the constable. Slate had heard the noise of the break-in, but apparently didn’t pin it on the newcomers to town.The next morning, the group rented a horse and buggy for 75 cents, and steered it to the north of town to survey the wooded region.Och, I bet there’s a faerie circle out there, or some Druids - “Gentleman” JerrySpying a metal fire control tower atop a rise, they approached and noted a “Keep Off” sign lying face-down next to the forty-foot ladder. A plaque described the dedication and purpose of the tower. The road was muddy and difficult so they had untethered Apple the horse and led him along. Aaron and Jerry clambered up the ladder, and opened the door to the hut on top of the tower. Both were startled by a shriek, and Larry nearly fell over the railing in fright. But it was just two local teenagers, named Betty Ward and Bobby Kirtland. The building also contained a hand-cranked siren and a log book. The log indicated the mill was struck by lightning on May 15th, 1911.The teens related the tale of a man, Elias Whipple, who had fallen or jumped from the perch to his death some time ago. Rumor was that he was found, missing his brain. They also told of lights in the forest, where Barnes often traveled by lantern light to a picturesque waterfall at the end of a walking path. They spoke fondly of Barnes’ two children, Mary (10) and Robert (12), who were sent away to boarding school six weeks ago. Their mother, Barnes’ wife, had succumbed to cancer some seven years ago.Sobered by the party’s ruse that they are Federal Truancy Officers investigating reports in this area, the children accompanied the explorers and Apple to the waterfall, which lies about a half mile away. It flows into a shallow pool, surrounded by ferns and wildflowers. Jerry waded into the pool and entered a hidden cavern behind the falls. He spotted a faint, short, pentagon-shaped doorway and a pentagon-shaped depression/keyhole.The day grew late, and the party intended to return to Foxfield in time for the 7:00 PM town council meeting. So they sent the teenagers home, and returned with Apple and the rented buggy.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1nWCtJxV9fIjDfpe_jZK2asJq2C_QbKnR51XbFcHZQ/edit#" }, { "title": "Episode 5 - Healing the Pyramid - July 24, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-5/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-07-24 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper   Todd “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor and jazz musician Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Eric Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Former bare-knuckles boxer Scott Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz former German POW Not Present Player Character Background Tom Oxford “Ox” Sykes Chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well JournalAaron and Jerry, Jesse/Jackson and Larry, slid carefully down the hardscrabble and climbed over a six foot tall ruined wall, then scaled the stepped pyramid. Larkin and Oxford stayed on top of the mountain with the guides and burros. After pouring three flasks of lantern oil into the three-inch wide crack, Aaron dropped a lit flare. The oily black smoke and overwhelming odor were hideous, though mitigated by moist face coverings. The earth shuddered, and Jerry fell hard upon the stony roof.The group attempted to discern the most likely location for a door or other entrance. Stiglitz thought the entrance to the tunnel to uncountable gold was either the big hole to the south, or, a partially debris-covered shaft to the north-east.The vertical shaft seemed reasonable, a diagonal shaft cut off several feet into its depths. Oxford lowered the block and tackle and the strong beam, down to the group before coming down to join the others, reaching the bottom without issue.“Gentleman” Jerry joined him. They drove a spike at the base of the shaft, affixed a rope, and tossed the loose end down the diagonal path. Ox descended and discovered stone tunnels. The last man down, “Skinny” Larry, tied off the rope to ensure the explorers could haul themselves back up, out of the shaft. The flies and stench continued to be pervasive.From the bottom of the slope, tunnels split into nearly every direction, only four feet high but ten feet side. The group of six headed to the west on hands and knees, Jerry in the lead. They chalked a line and turned west. The tunnel had a thin golden band along the left wall, with glyphs that looked the same as the small sample the party had received to kick off the expedition.Coming upon a pile of rags, sticks and detritus, they spotted a skull with something white and glistening moving in an eye socket. Jerry crushed it with an axe blow. The thing in the eye was a grub the size of a guinea pig, and it died instantly. The human body was ancient and had a few pocketable gold trinkets.Continuing west about another 30 feet, they found a sloping shaft going up. It was posited that it may open to the east of the pyramid. Jerry and Larry tried unsuccessfully to climb, and tumbled back to the hard stony ground. Continuing west then south, they noticed Oxford was missing from the group. They backtracked to find him taking a crowbar to the gold vein that they had been following.A crack opened up in the wall, from which seeped greasy white fat and a few of the white larval worms. Ox wouldn’t stop trying to pull the gold vein, so Aaron smacked him and tied him up. The larvae were stomped and squished. Larry pressed the gold back into the groove, and another tremor shook the tunnel.The group found another shaft, angled away from the gilded path. Aaron clambered up, finding himself at the base of a plugged-up vertical shaft. Further down, they spotted a section of missing gold matching the piece in their possession, but they also spotted a wriggling mass of gooey fat that seemed to be moving of its own volition.Aaron shot it. Or, shot at it.As part of this effect, the explorers found a four-foot-deep pool of glistening white fat, so Jerry slid in, with Larry on his back. A little grub tried to work its way towards Jerry’s “back door”, so he exited the fat to deal with it. After killing it and cinching rope around his thighs and tightening his belt, they tried again.Larry neatly re-affixed the missing section of metal, after which they dealt with the second slug that tried to get into Jerry’s nether regions. The crack sealed itself up, “healing” the wall. Ox passed out, unconscious.The team pressed on. Ox soon awakened, confused as to where he was. The group exited the tunnels beneath the pyramid. De Mendosa was waiting for them at the top of the shaft, thirty yards away, but he flaked apart into tiny pieces in the wind. Larkin was unconscious up on the ridge. The smell of rotting meat seems to have dispersed. Larkin looked to have regained some degree of health, his veins returning to a degree back to normal. Once roused, he inquired as to the haul of gold he assumed the explorers had discovered. They had in fact only found about $40 worth of trinkets.A second foray into the tunnel system beneath the pyramid ruins resulted in quite a haul. They found a subterranean campsite and some mounds of dust in the shape of bodies, along with a great deal of coins of both recent and ancient mint. Giving Jesse/Jackson his fair split, and a measure for the guides who had been exemplary in their support, each walked with a cool $5000.00!Back in Puno, they posed for a black and white photograph to commemorate their success. They knew that their future paths would certainly intersect with Jesse/Jackson, who promised to send them a signed copy of his next book.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUAtU14XG3ia3Tuio5SSoiN1RNi6iNAchRXwaaxdhFk/edit#" }, { "title": "Episode 4 - To the Pyramid - July 10, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-4/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-07-10 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Cast of Characters Player Character Background John Keeper   Todd “Skinny Larry” Simons Inventor and jazz musician Cyle Aaron Winters Occultist Tom Oxford “Ox” Sykes Chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Eric Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea Former bare-knuckles boxer Not Present Player Character Background Scott Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz former German POW JournalThe explorers gathered around Augustus Larkin’s bed, surveying the oily, sweaty man lying prone. His veins had begun bulging with black ichor, and the initial hours of heroin withdrawal had not been pleasant. And the smell - rotten meat - pervaded the room.They decided to take Larkin to their own, more upscale lodgings, for half a week or so. That way they could rotate a watch over the addict as others pursued their own agenda - learning a little more Spanish, reading up on folklore and mythology, Pizzaro’s journeys, and the like. It was hoped that three or four days of going “cold turkey” would be a reasonable start of the weaning-off process for his Heroin addiction.Out of curiosity, the group touched a crucifix, then the odd metal band, to Larkin’s flesh, especially his tattoo. Larkin seemed unsure of what would happen when touched by the crucifix, however it seemed to have no effect. His odor was not limited to his excrement, it seemed to exude from his breath and pores as well.Oxford,with his background in pharmacy, disposed of Larkin’s “supply”, and stashed a vial of it in case Larkin’s symptoms became overwhelming on the road. The team was well-prepared for every conceivable danger the jungle might throw at them.Soon the group became restless and decided to leave for their village destination, by truck. They would reach Puno in less than three days.Two days on the road resulted in their arrival, where they spent the night and switched from truck to burro. Three local guides (notably, practicing Catholics) accompanied them, as they knew the location of the ruins (pyramid) as well as the temperament of the beasts of burden (not counting “Gentleman” Jerry). Jerry visited a large church in the town, deriving some small comfort in the familiar liturgies in this foreign country.While investigating what Puno had to offer, perhaps a final chance to stock up, the team noticed a couple of tall, gaunt men in wide brimmed hats following them around town. Jerry attempted to catch them but they managed to escape into a crowd.The group began their climb into the mountains and, suspecting they would be tailed by the men in the wide-brimmed hats (Cultists), Aaron hung back and found their suspicions validated. The gaunt men spoke little and ate less as they walked. Aaron beat a wide arc around them and joined the main group at camp.The steady gain in altitude had a noticeable effect, but only Ox and Stig showed the full symptoms of altitude sickness. Ox in particular, perhaps due to his great size and preference for dry air, seemed particularly affected by the thin air. At times it was all the big man could do to stay upright on his great unsteady feet. He mentioned he has three quarters of a vial of heroin, in case anyone was suffering particularly badly from the altitude sickness. No one took him up on his offer.The formal historical name of the cult seemed to be something like, ”Kharisiri”.Sometime during the night one of the mules was killed, the next morning it was discovered desiccated, with an oval, bloody wound. It reminded them a bit of the poor young librarian, Trinidad Rizo. “Gentleman” Jerry treated poor Larkin in a less-than-gentlemanly fashion, keeping him shackled and manacled even during the night. Quizzical looks from the guides prompted Jesse/Jackson to inform them that Larkin was an addict, unstable, and likely to wander off during the night and possibly injure himself. Ox offered to provide Larkin with some heroin to ease his anxieties, noting that he is carrying half a vial. The group felt Larkin was better without it.On the road, Aaron and Jerry forked off and hid, and attacked the two villagers. Jerry shot one with his handgun while Aaron tussled with the other, which had clamped a sphincter mouth, lamprey-like, to the side of Aaron’s throat.After dispatching the two (rather than bleeding, they emitted a white fluid), they were rejoined by the larger group, and burned the dead bodies, which had notably distended stomachs, reminiscent of the poor elderly museum curator, Professor Nemesio Sanchez, who had passed from his injuries (a parasite courtesy of one de Mendosa). Adding an air of levity, Jerry donned one of the broad-brimmed hats, though the resemblance to the pale cultists ended there. Ox offered the vial, a quarter-full of heroin, to Aaron to help with the pain. Aaron declined, simultaneously realizing that Ox has been gradually using the heroin and that it should probably be disposed of.The second night was uneventful; while completing their final leg of travel to the ruins, they espied two more of the odd villagers (Cultists), but did not attempt to catch up to them. Thus, when the group crested a rise, the vista of the ruins beneath them, the two villagers were already below them, atop the largest ruin.Strangely they bent over and seemed (from forty yard’s distance) to vomit greasy fat into a crack in the building’s flat roof.Aaron and Jerry fired rifles at one of them, striking him and knocking him down. “Skinny” Larry hit the other one with his own long gun. The group was startled to see the injured cultists run and jump off the structure to the rocky ground, leaking white fluid.The group paused to consider the methods whereby they could enter the large walled area containing the ruins - by climbing down the steep bluffs, or by circling the rise to reach what appeared to be an open arch leading within. If the former was chosen, the guides would remain high on the bluff with the burros.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1xeIn1wpyOiC0cnKPpBtV5aGsQh9ckuS5R4R6uike6GQ/edit" }, { "title": "Episode 3 - To the Wilds of South America - June 12, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-3/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-12 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Present John - Keeper Todd - “Skinny Larry” Simons, Inventor and jazz musician Scott - Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz, former German POW Cyle - Aaron Winters, Explorer and Occultist Tom - Oxford “Ox” Sykes, chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Eric - Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea, former bare-knuckles boxerJournalPreamble: A visit to the Asylum to pass good words and religious paraphernalia to the insane husband and his somewhat more mentally sound wife. She may be able to go back into society at some point.Preamble: Yardwork to make the Corbitt house more pleasant to view from the street.Preamble:The Boston Department of Health removed Corbitt’s body and gave him a pauper’s burial.The loosely-knit team of former members of the armed forces, after each pocketing $10 from Knott for de-ghosting the Corbitt house, was presented with an opportunity for international travel. Ritter shared a newspaper article describing a visit to a Peruvian archeological site to search for ancient items of antiquity. His associate from years gone by, Augustus Larkin, was an explorer and was interested in sponsoring the team to assist in the dig.Targeting a date in March 1921, Ox persuaded the group to travel by ship rather than by plane. This would give them the opportunity to witness first-hand the operation of the recently-opened Panama Canal. Upon arrival they were to seek out Larkin after checking into the Hotel Maurie.To pass the time on this two-week journey by sea, several of the “more literate” team members took to studying the Spanish language. “Skinny” Larry and “Gentleman” Jerry passed their time learning about the ship’s operation, from a mechanical perspective. They met a young priest traveling for mission work, and shared with him the task of learning basic Spanish. Jerry spent down time with him praying, seeking guidance, and singing hymns from his old hymnal. Pequeño Burro - Little Burro - I like it, it’s sorta like calling me ‘tiny’ – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaUpon arriving in Lima, Peru, the squad checked-in at the Hotel Maurie and met Larkin and two other men in the hotel’s airy restaurant for dinner. Augustus Larkin - appeared much older and more thin/haggard than Ritter remembered Luis de Mendoza - Larkin’s assistant; older man, with worn but well-maintained clothes Jesse Hughes - black man well-versed in Folklore, wearing a Fedora, smoking a pipeThere was apparent tension and “bad blood” between assistant de Mendoza and folklorist Hughes.A welcoming dinner partyLarkin described a ten-day foray consisting of a few days’ travel in three trucks followed by a few days on burros. The launch site will be a village named “Puno”. He let the squad purchase items they required; Jerry purchased road flares, a handgun, long gun, and ammunition. Ritter acquired some rope and lanterns. Ox stocked up on medicine/pharmaceuticals to treat the expected jungle maladies like malaria, dysentery, etc. Larkin’s gotta be cursed, probably stole a relic from some long-dead Pharoah! – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaDinner was excellent, consisting of fresh-caught fish from the Pacific Ocean and free-flowing locally produced alcoholic beverages. After dinner the adventurers sat with Jesse Hughes for a drink or three. His lips loosened a bit by the libations, he related his real name, “Jackson Elias”, and was a somewhat well-known author on books of the occult, listing, among others: The Smoking Heart (Mayan Death Cult) Witch Cults of England (covens spanning nine countries)Judging the explorers to be men of good character, with some exposure to the unexplained, Jesse/Jackson related that an associate of his, one Professor Nemesio Sanchez, was interested in the expedition but Larkin would not return his phone calls nor offers to add his expertise to the effort (consisting in part of notes and documents regarding the dig site). Wishing to perform an introduction, they decided to meet the following day at a local Archeological Museum, where Sanchez worked in some administrative capacity.Jesse/Jackson made overtures about joining forces with this crew in order to uncover some of the mysteries of the ancient pyramid rather than the wholesale plunder of its riches and artifacts espoused by Larkin (who was, by his own admission, deeply in debt). Downing the remnants of their drinks, they went off to get a good night’s sleep. I stripped my bed to the mattress, looking for a snake, scorpion or spider. Check your boots, boys! – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaThe next morning, upon arrival at the museum, Jesse/Jackson guided them to Sanchez’s office. Sanchez explained that his assistant, a woman named Trinidad Rizo, was in the basement retrieving some items related to the dig site. Jerry helpfully left in search of the basement stairs, hoping to help carry any bulky items for the aide. Me poor, wee bairn! – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaHe did find Rizo, dead and dessicated with a wound on her throat, half-buried in items tipped upon her from a shelf that loomed over the corpse. He pocketed her small notebook and stuck a gold “pipe” inscribed with sigils and hieroglyphs, found in a broken, straw-filled crate, into the back of his belt. Then he scooped up her dead form to return to Sanchez’s office.The strip of worked gold found in the crateUpstairs, a shrill cry alerted the remaining team members, who rushed out front of the museum and down its stone steps, to provide aid to some unknown source. It was a ruse. No passers-by had heard or seen anything.Upon reaching the office, Jerry espied de Mendoza pinning the older Sanchez to the floor, and appearing to try to kiss the administrator. Dropping the corpse, Jerry rushed to knee the assaulter in the side of his head, but tripped upon (and became entangled with) an upholstered chair. De Mendosa took the opportunity to complete his attack and escape through a window (the office was on the first floor). As the others arrived, it was apparent that Sanchez was infected by a parasite that appeared to be moving under his skin, causing agony to the poor chap. Aaron and Ox attempted together to provide a remedy by poisoning the parasite, but were without success. Jerry plunged a silver-plated letter opener into Sanchez’s abdomen, a shallow stab, but failed to pierce the parasite.Chasing de Mendoza proved fruitless, the man had the advantage of knowing the surrounding streets and city blocks and leveraged these to effect his escape. Larry and Jerry returned, sweaty and breathing heavily.An ambulance was summoned (for the writhing Sanchez), followed by the police (for poor Trinidad). The gaping wound in the latter’s neck went unexplained. “Jesse … Jackson … if you betray me, I’ll hunt you down and kill ye, just as I’ve done three times past” – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaThe notebook described mid-sixteenth-century Conquistador Gaspar Figeuro, who was one of the explorers of the site near Puno. Jerry collected the papers and photos that had originally occupied Sanchez’s desk but had been strewn upon the floor. Examining the gold rod, reinforced by information gleaned from a second trip to the basement, it was related to the explorer Franciso Pizarro, as well as the aforementioned Gaspar Figeuro.It also mentioned one Luis de Mendoza, a traitor, who was shot in the head. These events transpired some 380 years in the past.“Och, that isn’t one of OUR de Mendoza’s ancestors, and it ain’t no random chance name. It’s the SAME de Mendoza, the bastard’s four hunnert years old!” - “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaThe gold pipe was inlaid with geometric patterns and glyphs, with odd pieces jutting out perpendicularly. It seemed to be neither a weapon nor scepter.Larkin at rest, his tattoo visibleIt was time for answers, and the source seemed to be one Augustus Larkin. Intruding into his room (at a different, shabbier hotel than the Maurie), they found him high on heroin, which explained his physical deterioration more … “scientifically” … than a mummy’s curse for stealing an ankh or similar relic of antiquity. It did not, however, explain why Larkin smelled of rotten meat; he seemed to not show any open, weeping sores or such. The drug use seemed to mimic the symptoms of Malaria - weight loss, sweats, a notable pallor - the whole business was terribly confusing. “Och, if I smelled like rotten meat, I’d shower in cologne too!” – “Gentleman” Jerry O’SheaWhen told of the death of Trinidad Rizo and the assault on Sanchez, Larkin vomited bile and small amounts of undigested food into the toilet.He babbled about a Death Cult of a Vampiric Monster named the “Careeserie”, but provided very little in terms of de Mendoza or any ulterior motives for the archeological dig (even under threat of being tossed out of the fifth floor window, or a quick punch to the gut). De Mendoza had signed on to the expedition as one knowledgeable about the location of the site and environs, and met him for a meal once a day or so.The five explorers gathered about the supine form of Larkin, glaring at him while he rested uneasily upon his bed.Tying things up Do we sequester Larkin and wean him from his addiction? Would he be more helpful without the heroin? Do we imprison him somewhere and strike out on our own, hoping to find a guide in Puno? Is he under a curse or similar malady and hoping the dig site might have the cure?" }, { "title": "Episode 2 - The Second Death of Walter Corbitt - May 22, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-2/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-05-22 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Present John - Keeper Todd - “Skinny Larry” Simons, Inventor and jazz musician Scott - Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz, former German POW Cyle - Aaron Winters, Occultist Tom - Oxford “Ox” Sykes, chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Eric - Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea, former bare-knuckles boxerJournalWhile others spent their time caring for their injuries and reading from Walter Corbitt’s three journals, Ox took a trip to Roxbury Sanitorium to check in on Vitorio and Gabriella Marcarios - two of the most recent tenants of Arnold Knott’s house. Vitorio had quite taken leave of his senses, and every response was punctuated with the phrase, “Evil!”, or a gesture towards his bible and a comment regarding the truths it held. His room was decorated with cheap knock-off crosses. He commented that his children had “Drank the evil”.The wife, Gabriella, was a lot more lucid, and spoke of the evils that dwell in the Knott house (hereafter referred to as the “Corbitt House”). She admitted that she could not say whether or not she really belonged in the asylum. The two children had gone south to live in Baltimore. Both of the married couple commented on a “Dark form with blazing eyes”. Gabriella related that dishes had flown through the air of their own volition, smashing against the wall or floor.The journals provided the insight that Corbitt was in general a mean, nasty individual. 1835 - earliest entry Home was purchase from a sick, infirm man 1852 - sued by neighbors for being a terrible neighbor Corbitt won the lawsuit for lack of compelling evidence, mostly hearsay He joined the church, which seemed to be an actual building Spoke of occult experiments in the “Chapel of Contemplation” A ritual to “Summon forth the opener of ways” 1866 - last entry Several blank pages at the endWith these new findings in hand, the investigators visited the public library and the Department (Registry) of Records. They gleaned the name of Corbitt’s legal representative in the court case, one William Parr, Esq. Visiting the cramped office of Parr’s grandson, they requested he pull out any old ledgers with information on the case from 1852.The Corbitt House was built in 1833.The Civil Court Recorder revealed the Church of Contemplation was led by the Reverend Michael Thomas.The executor of Wills provided no useful information regarding Corbitt, but the Records Registry had information about churches! The Chapel of Contemplation closed in 1912, and its address was provided.The group visited the address to find old, burned, weathered ruins, inside which an odd symbol was painted (?) upon one of the walls. (three joined “Y”s with a central eye). Two party members narrowly avoided falling into the basement by nimbly jumping aside, with help. Climbing down a rope, the party discovered a pair of skeletons in ancient, threadbare, silken purple robes, and a cabinet upon the wall.The two men seemed to have died from smoke inhalation.The cabinet revealed some moldy church records and another journal penned by Corbitt which mostly regarded the workings of the church. Disassembling the cabinet’s lower portion revealed a musty tome, the Libre Ivonis. Portions had rotten away, and what remained had been hand-scribed in Latin. The buzzing in Jerry’s head - which all had experienced - intensified, so he retired up the rope and to the vehicle parked out front.Upon vacating the premises, Jerry used a call-box to alert the police about the two skeletons and the danger of the structure, should one enter it without caution.Ox’s favorite high-end dry cleaners employed a man who recognized the old garments, many years ago they were brought for cleaning by … Reverend Michael Thomas.A second visit to William Parr III, Esq. revealed more information of interest, a police raid in 1912 had been the incident that closed the Chapel of Contemplation. The Reverend Michael Thomas had been arrested, though records were evasive regarding the charges.The reporter for the Boston Globe that had written a short article about the skeletons deserved a visit; George Wilson, a younger man, asked for any follow-up information the party could relate as he seemed fascinated by the history.The next five or six days were spent healing, and Jerry purchased a gardener’s spray can and several roadside flares.Upon re-entering the Corbitt House, the investigators went directly to the basement door. Aaron and Jerry went down, followed by Larry. Jerry rushed to the small, five-foot space he had uncovered a week prior, whose rear wall was a wooden door or wall, and proceeded to spray the area - including a dozen or two large rats - with kerosene. He noted a brief, odd, mental haze but was dead-set upon completing his plan. Striking a flare into brilliant red flame, he tossed it into the…closet (?), casually roasted the scuttling vermin that had caused him so much pain.Watching with satisfaction, he stomped the skulls of two that scampered about on the stone floor. Without warning, Aaron buried about three inches of the pointed tip of the pick-axe between Jerry’s shoulder blades.With the slightest exchange of angry words, Jerry proceeded to coat the rear wooden wall of the closet (?) with more kerosene. When Aaron grabbed his arm, Jerry shrugged, struck a second flare with his free hand, and tossed it underhand against the rear wooden wall, which was by now kerosene coated, noting a couple of still-twitching rats. The wooden paneling burst readily into flame.Gasping as the pain (and realization of betrayal) hit him, Jerry placed the sprayer - a metal can with two handles and a pump on top, and a hose with a trigger, upon the stone floor and limped to the staircase and up the steps, noting the old rug that Larry and Ox had spread out upon the rickety steps, passing Larry, who descended the wobbly stairs.Jerry sought out Ox, who had acquired Aaron’s rifle from the trunk of the car out front. Unable to treat himself due to the position of the deep gash, he pleaded with Ox for help, who patched him up. Breathing heavily he re-entered the house and leaned against the wall of the hallway outside the kitchen, while down in the basement, the scorched wooden wall was sundered by Aaron, at Ox’s behest.A small hole revealed a withered, nude male figure lying upon a crude altar. Aaron sought to fire a round into it, but his long gun was missing its firing pin. Instead, he fired Larry’s Colt Handgun, hitting it. It lay, unmoving. They tore down enough scorched wood to gain entry.As they examined the dessicated corpse, they noted a chain about its neck and little else. Suddenly, it reached out to Ox, circling his throat with its wickedly sharp nails! Blood oozed between its bony fingers as Aaron placed the revolver to the dead man’s temple, pulled the trigger, and its head exploded in a cloud of mold, dust, and bone.Walter Corbitt…or what had once been Walter Corbitt…was no more.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4OeW7ZUefyE8rjzOw1Ef5fX9DSzeSq-ZN4QtI4x48Q/edit?usp=sharing" }, { "title": "Episode 1 - The Rats - May 15, 2022", "url": "/gin-and-miskatonic/posts/Episode-1/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-05-15 00:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Present John - Keeper Todd - “Skinny Larry” Simons, Inventor and jazz musician Scott - Ritter Gunter von Stiglitz, former German POW Cyle - Aaron Winters, Occultist Tom - Oxford “Ox” Sykes, chemist and well-to-do ne’er-do-well Eric - Gerald “Gentleman Jerry” O’Shea, former bare-knuckles boxerJournalThe group gathered around a smoky table in a Boston tavern with a member of their former army company, Arnold Knott. Knott had inherited a Boston home from his uncle and has been unable to rent or sell it. The history of this old but with “good bones” house involved a married couple who went insane and were committed to a local asylum.Oxford knocked on the front door with his peacock-handled walking stick. No response. Upon entry, the investigators noted a long hallway ending in stairways leading up to the second floor and down to the basement. A perimeter search around the house revealed front and side doors and a door to a coal chute, securely nailed shut. The grounds certainly looked to require some work as it was quite overgrown but otherwise unremarkable.The entry level contained two storage rooms, a mudroom (with the side door), a kitchen, dining room and living room. The power was out, but inserting a couple of fuses and flipping the master power switch in the fuse box resulted in lights powering on. Extra fuses from a drawer were left in the box for ease of finding later. The mahogany dining room table had three unused place settings and a serving bowl of rotten soup. The mudroom contained coats for an adult man and woman and a few children. The kitchen cabinets held some cans of soup and rotten produce. The radio in the living room worked, once power was restoredThe primary finding on this first floor was a free-standing cabinet, nailed shut, containing a stack of diaries penned by one W. Corbitt. (Deceased, 1866.)The second floor contained three bedrooms and an unremarkable bathroom. One bedroom appeared to be for two small boys, while the spare bedroom had a heavy bed frame but no mattress. Crosses and other religious items were displayed conspicuously in the master bedroom.The Corbitt HouseAs the group prepared to descend rickety steps to the basement, they were alerted by a few loud thumps upstairs. As they entered the spare bedroom, whose door was opening and shutting, thought to be caused by the group’s attempts to let fresh air blow through the musty abode, Jerry was almost struck by the bed frame as it hurtled across the room. The group espied blood dripping down the inside of the window. Jerry scribed “WHO?” in the blood with his index finger.Aaron and Jerry felt their sanity slowly slipping away after witnessing the bed flying on its own. Oxford was skeptical that the bed moved “of its own volition” and checked for a hidden spring or some other mechanism. While searching Oxford was struck by the same piece of furniture as it returned to its original position. No mechanical cause of its animation could be determined and Oxford now also believed that the bed moved on its own. Jerry grabbed two of the larger crosses from the master bedroom and placed them around his neck.As they prepared once again to descend to the basement, Ritter left to speak to any neighbors and businesses nearby.The stairs were dangerous and fraught with peril. (So much so that Ox declined to go down then, and he went to the foyer to read the Corbitt diaries. ) Aaron lit his lantern providing 360 degrees of illumination and handed it to Larry. He had a carbide headlamp as well. The basement lights kept going out and each time Oxford replaced the oddly missing fuse, it was soon found to be missing again. Jerry placed a cross in the fuse box but it didn’t help. The spare fuses lined up, ready for use, were missing as well.The floor was littered with debris, including some lumber, nails, screws, and tools.They opened a door in the basement, revealing the delivery end of the coal chute, faint light filtering in from the closed hatch, above. Jerry picked up a trash can lid to use as a makeshift shield and a sturdy axe. Larry borrowed a brick-layer’s hammer and began tap-tap-tapping on the stone-tiled floor, looking for the means to go a level deeper. Jerry started to pull down old paneling.An ornamental dagger with a curved, rusty blade arose of its own volition, but was kept in check by Aaron and Jerry, who drove it, spike-like, into one of the exposed studs with the butt of the axe. Nevertheless it started to shimmy loose, so Jerry struck it, attempting to snap off the hilt.Upstairs Oxford, who had been reading the diaries, rolled up a dusty area rug and brought it to the top of the stairs, hoping the heavy fabric might entangle and corral the dancing dagger.The knife pulled free, though somewhat bent, and flew to a position across the room. Aaron and Larry fled up the stairs, whereas Jerry approached the dagger, axe at ready, and split it in two with a heavy blow. The pieces fell to the cluttered basement floor and moved no more.Undeterred, Jerry continued his task of trying to find a secret door by the method of brute force, tearing down more soft, aged pieces of wood paneling. Though the others had retreated up to the relative safety of the ground level, they reached the lantern down to light up the basement.Upon tearing down a particularly soft piece of paneling, he revealed a five-foot deep recess terminating in a wooden wall, occupied by several dozen angry rats who scurried over his form, biting, rending, and tearing his flesh. He retreated with a yelp, staggered up the steps with his remaining energy, and was treated by Aaron. After which he was driven by Aaron to the VA hospital for stitches, application of antiseptics, and intravenous treatment to combat disease, swelling, and infection.The others decided to take this time to read the diaries and investigate the property deed and chain of ownership of this odd property, by consulting county records and newspaper articles. Ritter had spoken to the proprietor of the cigarette and magazine shop, who related that the place made him feel uneasy, to the point of crossing the street in the evening rather than passing too closely. He also gave more information about “The Corbitt House”. The Macario family, the family that last lived there, moved into the house a couple of years ago. About a year after moving in, the father had a serious accident and shortly thereafter went violently mad, babbling about a haunting form with burning eyes. A few months ago, the old lady, Mrs. Macario also went mad. Apparently they’re both over in Roxbury Sanitarium, a few miles from Boston, the kids are down in Baltimore with relatives.Original Google Dochttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qo11281BdUifizPrwkN1ReVpRgZxtO0Lzln7dKml3oc/edit?usp=sharing" } ]
