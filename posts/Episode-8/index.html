He has a feisty, friendly air about him. As an orphan in Stratford, Connecticut, he learned to make his own way early in life. He has no living relatives, and no permanent address.</p><p>You like him, and value his friendship, even though months and sometimes years separate one meeting from the next. You’d be upset and probably crave vengeance if anything happened to your friend. The world is a better place for having Jackson Elias in it.</p><p>Elias speaks several languages fluently and is constantly traveling. He is social, enjoys an occasional drink, and smokes a pipe. A tough, stable, and punctual man, Elias is unafraid of brawls or officials.</p><p>He is mostly self-educated. Once a skeptic, Elias began to question his stance after the events he witnessed in the mountains of Peru, although in most cases he has failed to find proof of supernatural powers, magic, or dark gods. His well-researched works always seem to reflect first-hand experience. Possibly his greatest flaw is that he’s secretive, and never discusses a project until he has a final draft in hand.</p><p>His writings characterize and analyze death cults. His best-known book is Sons of Death, exposing modern-day Thuggee cults in India. All of his books illustrate how cults manipulate the fears of their followers. Insanity and feelings of inadequacy characterize death cultists; feelings for which they compensate by slaughtering innocents to make themselves feel powerful or chosen. Cults draw the weak-minded, though cult leaders are usually clever and manipulative. When fear of a cult stops, the cult vanishes.</p><p>Elias’ published works include:</p><ul><li>Skulls Along the River (1910)-exposes headhunter cults in the Amazon basin.<li>Masters of the Black Arts (1912)-surveys supposed sorcerous cults throughout history.<li>The Way of Terror (1913)- analyzes systematization of fear through cult organization; warmly reviewed by George Sorel.<li>The Smoking Heart (1915)-first half discusses historical Mayan death cults, the second half concerns present-day Central American death cults.<li>Sons of Death (1918)-modern-day Thuggees; Elias infiltrated the cult and wrote a book about it.<li>Witch Cults of England (1920)-summarizes covens in nine English counties; interviews practicing English witches; Rebecca West thought some of the material trivial and overworked.<li>The Black Power (1921)-expands upon The Way of Terror and includes some material on Asian and African death cults; includes interviews with several anonymous cult leaders.<li>The Hungry Dead (1923)-exposes the modern-day survival of a Peruvian and Bolivian death cult from the time of the conquistadors. It omits many of the weirder details that those who accompanied Elias on his researches may remember, presenting the cult of the kharisiri as a purely human evil.</ul><p>All of these books are published by Prospero House of New York City, and were edited by owner/editor Jonah Kensington. Kensington is a good friend of Jackson Elias and someone you may have previously met.</p><h1 id="news-stories">News Stories</h1><p>Here is some old news, backstory, and clues relevant to the next adventure.</p><h2 id="old-message-from-jackson-elias"><span class="mr-2">Old Message from Jackson Elias</span><a href="#old-message-from-jackson-elias" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><blockquote><p>HAVE INFORMATION CONCERNING CARLYLE EXPEDITION STOP NEED RELIABLE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM STOP MEET JANUARY 15 NEW YORK STOP JACKSON ELIAS</p></blockquote><p><img data-src="/gin-and-miskatonic/images/posts/8/expedition-1.png" alt="Telegram" data-proofer-ignore> <em>Telegram</em></p><h2 id="from-the-new-york-pillarriposte-april-4th-1919"><span class="mr-2">From the New York Pillar/Riposte, April 4th, 1919</span><a href="#from-the-new-york-pillarriposte-april-4th-1919" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>BIG APPLE DATELINE</p><p>ROGER CARLYLE the playboy whom everybody knows - or knows about - is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt!

On a snowy winter day, we arrived at room 410, rapped on the door, and got no response. A hotel maid let us in, which is where we witnessed three goons standing over Jackson’s corpse. The killed him with a knife, and we got let ‘em have it.</p><p>When all was said and done, we had one live and one dead goon to hand over to the police. Lt. Martin Pool was the beat cop we met.

Jackson ELias reached out to me via telegram to meet him at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 401. The group got together and headed over. No one answered as we knocked, so we suppressed the urge to break down the door, and instead asked the maid, a dozen rooms down, to check in on our friend.</p><p>We happened upon three men standing over the bloody body of our friend, lying on the bed. Each man wore a leather headband from which hung a piece of red ribbon or cloth. One cleared the open window, to the fourth floor fire escape and started descending. The second felt the fury of my uppercut, while the third crumpled, shot by one of our pistols - I don’t know whose. The maid ran screaming down the hallway, I was hoping she had the sense to call the police..</p><p>A second murderer leapt through the window, leaving a crimson trail. I jumped through the window but didn’t quite clear its width, and stumbled out onto the icy latticework. I heard another shot behind me - my friends sure are trigger-happy.</p><p>The first fellow was down at about the second floor, preparing to slide down the ladder. I saw a black Hudson Roadster waiting in the snowy alley - the getaway vehicle ! I judged that I could catch the straggler, so I dashed down a few steps and launched myself at his fleeing form.</p><p>Luck was on my side, or maybe it was my Guardian Angel, as I landed heavily on the man and pinned him down, then proceeded to ram his head against the steel platform. I took a shot at the car’s tire with my service revolver, but doubt I even hit the vehicle, at the odd angle and such.</p><p>I was surprised that the car sped down the length of the alley, and ended up sliding and skidding and up on its side. The guy running for it just passed it by and made good his escape. I heard sirens nearby - sometimes the cops are on top of things.</p><p>I trussed up my unconscious buddy and hauled him back to room 401. My pals had already collected Jackson’s stuff. Including a Shanghai Matchbook, Photo of a Chinese Junk, Letter from a Harvard Professor, a Business card from Penhew something or other, a card from Emmerson Imports something or other, and a sort of playbook describing a two hour lecture that had already happened. What a bunch of unrelated clues.</p><p>Lt Martin Poole told us this was the ninth such murder, my friends telling me of an odd carving in our poor friend’s forehead, like two quarter moons facing each other with some dots in between. Gruesome stuff.</p><p>Stig called Miskatonic University and tried unsuccessfully to contact the speaker, an Anthony Cowles, I think he was a guest from Sydney or something. I think that’s in Australia. Anyway, he couldn’t get through to him.</p><p>Lt Poole told us about a man captured in an alleyway in Harlem holding a bloody Bowie knife over murder victim number eight, one Hilton Adams - currently in Sing Sing awaiting an up close ‘n personal meeting with ‘Ol Sparky. A Bowie Knife? The guys that offed our pal Jackson carried out the brutality with these machetes called “Pangas”.</p><p>Poole referred us to the Harlem Precinct, where we met Captain Robbson. One of my buds thought he was dressed a little sharp for a Captain - I don’t know. Fashion ain’t my thing. Was he on the take?</p><p>Robbson verified something I already knew, since I had gone to the library and talked a helpful librarian into helping me collect the other eight newspapers with the other deaths reported. Didn’t hurt that she was a fetching lass - oh, my oaths! Anyway, seven of the eight were clustered in one part of Harlem, one was a bit outside but still in Harlem, and Jackson died well outside of the borough. What else? The black Hudson had been stolen, the driver and the guy I had landed on top of were in custody, and no, we couldn’t have one of the headband things.</p><p>The smarter among us told me that Robbson just wanted this whole Hilton Adams thing to be buttoned up neatly.</p><p>Of course we bought the day’s paper with the article of Jackson’s death. We decided to hunt down his agent, Jonah Kensngton, in New York City, at the “Prospero House”. Oh, Jackson Elias would be buried on Sunday, January the 18th, 2PM. Not really though, ‘cause the ground was frozen. Back to the article - it was penned by Rebecca Shosenburg. We stopped in at the Newspaper’s main office, her desk was remarkably neat and orderly. She opened up when we told her we thought Hilton Adams was “set up”. All eight murders had occurred during a New Moon, over about a two year period. Adams was in prison for over a year, now.</p><p>Oh, there was a Total Eclipse coming up on the 25th, in about a week.</p><p>Now we found out that Jackson Elias’ lawyer was named Carlton Ramsey, and there would be a reading of the will after the funeral. We were in it.</p><p>I had thumbed through the two books on African folklore I had checked out from the library, it only hinted at an African Cult in Nairobi.</p><p>The Newspaper gal (Rebecca) said she would set up a meeting with Millie Adams, Hilton’s wife. Maybe she could fill in some piece of this puzzle. To further cement our fledgling relationship, we promised her the right of first refusal on anything we discovered that was article-worthy and needed a byline.</p><p>The one card from Emerson Imports Facility pointed to Arthur Emerson, with connections to Mombasa (I really need a map of Africa). I took a smoke on the corner while the prettier among us talked to this import guy. I heard second-hand that Silas Kwamay runs a place called Ju-Ju House at 1 Ransom Ct New York City and … um … dealt with an Exporter named Aja Singh, Was Aja Singh Arthur Emerson’s contact? Don’t know.</p><p>We were to meet Millie at the Black Playhouse, the Lafayette Theatre.</p><p>A letter from Elias had hinted one of the Carlysle Party (in Africa, of course) had survived, after all. We had read somewhere that everyone had been hacked up real good, whites and blacks.</p><p>Skinny Larry had taken a shine to Rebecca, the Newspaper gal, so when he met her for dinner, I bought Stig a steak dinner at an inconspicuous corner table, just in case anyone started any trouble. Because we attract that sorta thing.</p><h2 id="friday-january-16-1925"><span class="mr-2">Friday January 16, 1925</span><a href="#friday-january-16-1925" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p><img data-src="/gin-and-miskatonic/images/posts/8/nyt-article.png" alt="Jackson Elias' Death" data-proofer-ignore> <em>Jackson Elias’ Death</em></p><h3 id="from-the-journal-of-lawrence-simons-1"><span class="mr-2">From the journal of Lawrence Simons</span><a href="#from-the-journal-of-lawrence-simons-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>We made arrangements to meet Millie Adams, the wife of Hilton Adams, at the Lafayette Theater tomorrow.</p><p>We also visited Jackson Elias’ publisher, and got all his notes.</p><p>Also learned Carleton Ramsey is Elias’ lawyer.
